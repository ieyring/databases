Little do these students realize that, in doing so, they are throwing good money away. As unbelievable as it may seem textbooks, in some cases, actually cost as much, if not more, than tuition.</P>\r\n<P>On the surface the college bookstore may seem like a convenient source for textbooks. Titles are usually in-stock and students may purchase new textbooks or opt for the cheaper alternative of used books. In truth the money saved by purchasing used textbooks from the college bookstore is only a fraction of the amount that students could be saving if they shopped online.</P>\r\n<P>More and more online booksellers have begun selling textbooks at a considerable discount off of the cover price. In fact, many major booksellers now have special areas of their web sites that are devoted to selling nothing but textbooks. Online used bookstores are another source for college books as they stock a large number of textbooks, which means sizable savings for students. There are also web-based retailers whose inventory is entirely devoted to college books.</P>\r\n<P>Students should avoid purchasing their textbooks at the first store that they browse. Instead, they should investigate the alternatives offered by other online booksellers. Price isn''t the only factor to consider when making an online purchase. Students should also factor in shipping costs and delivery time when making their buying decision.</P>\r\n<P>Online auctions are another option for students seeking a bargain. This option, however, has its pros and cons. A plus is that students can get incredible bargains when obtaining books via online auctions. One downside is that established retailers have channels in place to ensure that you receive your order within a reasonable amount of time. With an auction purchase, however, you are at the mercy of the auction seller''s timetable. </P>\r\n<P>One way that students can really save is by obtaining books for free. Project Gutenberg is one resource that English majors will find invaluable. At this site students can peruse a vast collection of classics that have entered the public domain. In the past students seeking assistance with their studies had to pay for the privilege of that help by purchasing study guides. Today that is no longer the case. Cash-strapped students can now visit Spark Notes for free downloadable study guides as well as free downloadable classics. </P>\r\n<P>Students who elect to buy online will no longer be able to resell their books to the college bookstore at the end of class, but that doesn''t mean that they are stuck with the textbooks. Many web sites that sell textbooks also offer students the option of selling their books to fellow bargain-seekers. This allows students to easily recouping a portion of their money.</P>\r\n<P>Textbooks normally consume a major portion of a student''s budget, but that doesn''t have to be the case, because while the cost of tuition may be set in stone the price of textbooks isn''t. By taking the time to do a little research on the best textbook values available college students can save money now rather than acquiring debt to be paid back later.</P>\r\n<P>Copyright © 2004 Heather Wallace</P></FONT><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><FONT size=2>\r\n<P>Heather Wallace is founder of <a target="_new" href="http://www.BargainMartian.com">http://www.BargainMartian.com</a> Visit to take advantage of the out of this world bargains from leading merchants found in this comprehensive directory of deals, rebates, bargains, coupons, and money-saving offers.</P></FONT><!--UdmComment-->');

Online expert, Dr. Jeanette Cates, The Technology Tamer, walks you through the decisions and provides several suggestions.', '<P>You''ve already decided that you''re ready to author online and you have your content organized. Now it''s time to face the ultimate challenge in online learning - making it interactive!</P>\r\n<P>Interaction in online courses is a two-edged sword. On one hand you want students to participate. This enhances their learning by letting them question and discuss issues in the course. On the other hand, as the instructor, you need to decide the level of interaction you want to have with each student - and build your courses accordingly.</P>\r\n<P>As an illustration, let me relate a poor choice I made in a course I wrote several years ago. Because I wanted everyone involved, I required that each student post at least one message per week to the discussion group. In addition, I required that they respond to two other messages. Simple? Yes. But because I had decided that my level of involvement was to respond to every posting, I was faced with 3 messages for every student every week - and this was only the minimum requirement! I soon found myself bogged down in responding to an overwhelming number of messages.</P>\r\n<P>To decide on your level of involvement, let''s look at 5 levels of interactions you can provide.</P>\r\n<P>1. Respond to every email. At this level of interaction, you are reading and responding to every email or discussion sent. Beware. While this may be effective at the beginning of a discussion when there is little interaction, you''ll soon be overwhelmed just responding to and encouraging students.</P>\r\n<P>2. Respond to every nth email. This is a more rational view. Here you can decide to pick every 5th posting and respond to it. The danger is that you''ll miss a student''s best posting or that you''ll miss an important question.</P>\r\n<P>3. Respond to 1 message per student per week. You can set the expectation that you''ll welcome questions from everyone, but that you''ll only guarantee a response to one per week. That will put the burden of composing an effective message on the student''s shoulders, rather than just jotting off a quick question every time they think of it. </P>\r\n<P>4. Post provocative questions. This is a great way to get a discussion started. If you choose this route, you may choose not to participate in the discussion yourself - but instead, just summarize it at the end - or not.</P>\r\n<P>5. Employ help. This may be a Teaching Assistant, a mentor, students who have taken the course in the past, etc. You may also choose to separate the types of correspondence - for example, one person may cover technical questions, while another handles course mechanics and you take the content questions.</P>\r\n<P>Now that you''ve decided on your level of involvement, it''s time to design the exercises. Recognize that almost any type of exercise you use in face-to-face training has an online counterpart. So be creative - and try your ideas. You can even ask your fellow instructors for help by saying "In an instructor-led course we would do such-and-such for this lesson. What would you suggest we use to replicate that learning online?"  </P>\r\n<P>Keep in mind that the format of the course you are creating will help determine the appropriateness of an interactive exercise. For example, if you have a rolling enrollment, self-paced course where students sign up and work through the materials at their own pace, it may be difficult to assign them team activities. </P>\r\n<P>To get you started here are some ideas for interactive exercises. These cover a variety of levels of interaction, so choose your favorites. </P>\r\n<P>Polls and surveys - ask a series of questions, then summarize the results for the participants. This can be done with a survey tool or you can use a multiple choice exam. Poll early and often. Your first poll might be the type of computer participants use, how they connect to the Internet, and their level of expertise in computer skills. This provides good feedback to you and gives them a profile of the "average" student. </P>\r\n<P>Go and do - give students an assignment to do offline. Then ask them to come back and use one of the other techniques (reflection, chat, summaries) to report on their activities.</P>\r\n<P>Read and react - give students an article, a series of websites, or other assignment. Then ask them to write a short reaction paper based on their readings.</P>\r\n<P>Reflection - ask each student to use their personal note space to reflect on reading/group discussions.</P>\r\n<P>3-word summary - ask each student to summarize their thoughts in 3 words in the discussion group. Others can ask for clarification.</P>\r\n<P>Teams - use teams to create small discussion groups. Then ask one person from each team to summarize the discussion in the larger discussion area.</P>\r\n<P>Office hours - use a chat to hold weekly office hours. Just tell everyone when you''ll be "in", then wait for the questions. As an alternative you may decide to offer a chat time to a smaller group or team of students - either to encourage more interaction or to handle what would have been an overwhelming amount of interaction.</P>\r\n<P>Expert panel - invite one or more experts to participate in a live event such as a video or audio conference. Take questions from the audience. Then continue the discussion with the discussion group. If possible, invite the experts to participate in the discussion. </P>\r\n<P>You will continue to discover new interactive exercises that you use with your courses.

In this informative article, Jeanette S. Cates, “The Technology Tamer” helps you think this through.', '<P>There are so many ways to deliver instruction online that the topic warrants its own lesson. In fact, deciding how you are going to deliver a course is critical to the way that you design and develop the course!</P>\r\n<P>Your first decision is whether or not you will deliver the course "live" or in a synchronous mode. If you deliver it live, it means that you and the students need to be online at the same time. There are numerous courses delivered this way. One of the oldest models for this is a telephone course. </P>\r\n<P>You can also deliver a teleseminar, which is a fancy way of saying a course via telephone. In a teleseminar, everyone calls into a central number where there is a "telephone bridge". The bridge can handle many simultaneous connections, so everyone can hear one another. And because everyone pays their own long distance bill to the bridge, it''s an affordable technology to use. Bridge pricing varies, but if you''re paying over $20 per hour to rent the bridge, then contact us and we''ll put you in touch with a more reasonably priced vendor!</P>\r\n<P>A variation on the telephone seminar is a video conferencing course. You can use a dedicated video conferencing system or some of the newer internet-based web cameras. But recognize that unless everyone is on a fast line (cable or DSL), the video quality will be disappointing. In fact, unless there is a reason that you need to see one another, I always recommend audio conferencing instead. A good example of the use of audio conferencing is at wizetrade.com where they offer a weekly tutorial using internet audio conferencing. (Click on support to see the weekly schedule. You can tune in free to see how it works.)</P>\r\n<P>Other vendors provide a blended model of live telephone with live web. Three of the largest vendors in this space are webex.com , centra.com , and letsconference.com . For each of these, you call a telephone number to get the audio, then tune into a website to see the slides and other accompanying materials. Some services also offer a web audio option, so that no one needs to pay a long distance fee. Many of these vendors have also included enhancements such as live polls during the lesson, a "follow-me" type of Internet tour of sites, and the ability to carry on conversations during the class via a chat feature. Try to participate in at least one of each brand so that you are aware of the opportunities.</P>\r\n<P>While live delivery has its place in web-based learning, it takes away one of the primary advantages assigned to online courses - the ability to learn anywhere, anytime. So if you want to provide that advantage, then you must assume an asynchronous mode of delivery. This type of delivery requires that you think through all of the course, design each lesson, then post the lessons for the students. Whereas with a "live" course you can assume that the instructor will prepare and deliver each lesson, an asynchronous course takes a lot more prior planning.</P>\r\n<P>Even here there are numerous options. Here are some questions you need to answer as you are outlining the features of your course:<BR>* Will you have an instructor for the course? (instructor-facilitated)<BR>* Will all of the students start and end the course at the same time? (lock-stepped enrollment)<BR>* Will the instructor "release" the learning materials at a particular time of the week or will students be able to progress at their own rate? (student-paced or instructor-paced)<BR>* If you don''t have an instructor for a course, how will you handle student questions?<BR>* How will you measure student progress through a course? Do you need to?<BR>* Will you certify course completion or are the students on their own as to whether or not they finish the course?<BR>* How will the choice of instructor-facilitated impact your staffing requirements for the course?<BR>* How will you train the staff to facilitate the course?<BR>* Will you allow student-to-student interaction? If so, how will you facilitate that?</P>\r\n<P>As you can see there are a lot of questions to be answered as you plan a course. </P>\r\n<P>P.S. Did I mention that you can also deliver a course via email?

This is taken into consideration when looking for a place to study, and this shouldn''t mean below par education.  It should mean convenience for those interested in education and furthering their portfolios.</p><p>Student Commitment</p><p>Distance Learning requires a certain amount of commitment as the student must schedule the time to study.  This is also reflective in their work as they are not going to afford the time unless genuinely interested in the subject matter.  The work from these students shows a clear interest in their progression, and therefore their time is not wasted on courses that they are only taking for UKAS points.</p><p>Flexibility</p><p>A high standard is reached as there is very little disruption in the pupil''s life, and therefore they find that they are able to concentrate on the subject matter fully.  These courses are not as expensive as those that have to hire out a classroom, and with the ''email'' style of assessment, the cost to complete their course assignments is inconsequential.  There is no waiting for weeks for their assessments to be returned to them, and this makes it easier for the student to get on with their work at their own pace.  These courses fit into lifestyles as it is usually humanly impossible to gauge when a situation will arise that takes a student away from their studies, but with the Distance Learning option, these students do not have the worry of catching up, or even having to loose out on their whole course and fee because there has been a glitch in their schedule.  The course can be put aside, and picked up when the situation is eradicated.  For those who travel for work, their course can be taken with them, affording them the time to continue on with their studies.</p><p>Different options for different lifestyles</p><p>This form of education is taking a front seat for those interested in continuing study after settling into a career, or starting a family.  There are numerous reasons for not being able to put your life on hold to study a preferred topic, and this option is sometimes the only way people are able to get the training they need.  This should not mean that these people have to put up with inferior courses, or exorbitant fees.  For those who are unable to leave their homes, or not able to physically enrol on classroom taught courses, this form of education plays a paramount importance in their lives.  Oxford College ODL and Oxford Distance Learning have devised a scheme for the visually impaired by designing their courses specifically for these people''s needs, and they are in the process of  setting up a program to fit into those people''s lives that have difficulty in finding a course that caters for their special needs.</p><p>Grading</p><p>Distance learning courses are not easy.  Because the student is not required to attend classes, it is imperative that a sound assessment of their absorption of the materials is obtained by the tutor, and this is only obtained through assignments that are usually more in depth than the usual grading process that is awarded through classroom taught courses.  This takes it''s form by enabling the student into not just learning about a given subject, but also showing their understanding of each individual step in essay form which lends to their overall grade.  This is particularly important to the student, as the material is not the only information that needs to be taught in a given subject.  The student needs to be able to question the material, and use their own reasoning when it comes to analysing what they are asked to absorb which keeps them interested in the course work and sees that they feel more involved with the process of their learning.</p><p>In the words of Mike Tomlinson, former chief inspector of schools,</p><p>''Too much time is spent preparing for exams which could be used for learning''.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Written by Angela Williams, Education Standards Reviewer ‘UK Education Today’.

Not just girls.  Not \r just Ivy League aspirants.</p><p>High school students are always convinced their parents \r don’t understand them.  This time the students are right.  \r Parents don’t understand because the college admission \r process is so much more competitive than it was when \r most parents applied to college.</p><p>These are the ten things I wish I could tell parents:</p><p>1.  I am convinced that parents have to walk a mile in the \r student’s moccasins to gain some appreciation for the \r stress the students are under and to reverse the tension at \r home.  If parents will take an SAT practice test they will feel \r some of the same anxiety, cringe at their results, and \r discover that the test is hard. Instead of piling 25 pounds of \r SAT study books on the desk, parents can commiserate \r with students over missed problems.  Parents and students \r can become allies rather than adversaries as they face the \r college admission process.</p><p>2.  Hire SAT prep tutors who focus on the applicable \r academic material rather than just the tricks.  Increasing a \r student’s academic preparation for the test in addition to \r teaching the tricks increases their confidence on the test \r and in the classroom; teaching only the tricks makes \r students more insecure because they are relying on tricks \r rather than on actual knowledge.</p><p>3.  Have the tutors keep the parents informed about each \r session so that the parent tracks progress with the tutor \r rather than pestering the student for information.</p><p>4.  Have the student try the ACT.  All colleges accept it and \r some students do better on it than on the SAT.</p><p>5. Make learning fun.  For example, have the students \r memorize vocabulary using the book Vocabulary Cartoons \r by Sam Burchers, et al.  Also, have the student do the \r crossword and other word puzzles in SAT Vocabulary \r Express, the fun book of word puzzles that will increase SAT \r scores.  I wrote it with Michael Ashley, a nationally known \r puzzler, so that our students would learn to play with words, \r an important skill for the new SAT.</p><p>6.  Emphasize getting good grades rather than good SAT \r scores.  Bs in honors classes are better than As in regular \r classes.</p><p>7.  Hire an independent college counselor who will work \r with the family to create a realistic college list, brainstorm for \r essay topics, establish deadlines for the student, and check \r all college applications.  High school college counselors \r are overworked and do not have the time to walk families \r through the process.</p><p>8.  Realize that the schools parents attended may not be \r within reach for their child.  The number of high school \r students planning to attend college has increased \r dramatically; the student may be well qualified for a \r particular college and may still not get in.</p><p>9.  Look for colleges where the student will thrive \r academically and socially.  Choosing colleges based on \r their name recognition and prestige value is a formula that \r will increase stress, not decrease it.  Everyone else wants \r to go to those schools, too, making them even harder to get \r into; they are not necessarily the best place for the student.  \r Loren Pope’s book, Colleges That Change Lives, is a good \r place to start.</p><p>10.  Support your child through a difficult process.  Leave the \r prodding, nagging, and yelling to the tutors and college \r counselor.  The independent college counselor will tell the \r student to work harder so the parent doesn’t have to. Why \r ruin the student’s last year at home?</p><p>Parents can make decisions so that senior year is not be so \r fraught with anxiety that family members begin to avoid each \r other.

Years ago we kept it simple -- the must have storage staple was the old dairy crate and that was pretty much it. Those dairy crates organized everything from sweaters and sweatshirts to books. Today the storage choices are almost unlimited (although the budget may not be...), so outfitting a dorm room or first apartment can be a bit overwhelming. I have asked our summer intern (a college student) to share some organizing challenges she has experienced first hand. We have divided the typical college living space into 5 areas:</p><p>- Common area <br>\r - Kitchen and bath area Desk <br>\r - Bedroom or sleeping area <br>\r - The always too small and functionally challenged closet. <br>\r - Common Area</p><p>Question: “A lot of dorm rooms are small and have one common area. What would you suggest to help students keep their common area organized? Also, can you suggest some useful products for storing food, movies, and CDs?”</p><p>Answer: Common areas can be a tricky, because you have now entered the zone where your belongings are community property. I would suggest a minimalist approach. If it is for a dorm, keep it simple and portable. There are inexpensive multimedia racks, drawers and even cubes (the “new” dairy crate!) available for storing CDs and movies.</p><p>Trunks can provide additional table surface, store out-of-season blankets and sweaters, and even make a good hiding place for your spare laundry and bathroom supplies. If you are furnishing an apartment, make it a group project so that everyone is involved with choices and expense sharing.</p><p>Many students store their snacks and munchies where they hang out, so just remember to label them and stay clear of glass. Many discount stores have some really cool and inexpensive dry storage options.</p><p>Kitchen and Bath</p><p>Question: “Can you give advice on how to keep your stuff separate from your roommates in both the kitchen and the bathroom?”</p><p>Answer: In the kitchen -- label, label and label. People are less likely to help themselves to something when it is clearly marked. An alternate system is to divide the shelves in the refrigerator – maybe one for each person and one common shelf? If your budget permits, purchase a set of food storage containers and clearly label them with your name and any warning you may want to include. Unfortunately there will always be those few who will help themselves to anything and everything, so don’t sign a lease with them next year.</p><p>There is never enough room in the bathroom, so keep it simple and portable. Buy a shower tote or caddy; a proven product that has been around for years. I recommend girls go for the largest one you can carry while most guys could probably make do with the smaller ones. If finding a surface is an issue consider a hanging dopp kit, which can be easily hooked on to a towel rack. Don’t forget about your towels; consider large hooks for hanging wet towels. Extra towels and toiletries can be stored in a simple 4-drawer storage cabinet also available at many discount stores and other retailers.</p><p>The Desk</p><p>Question: "What would you suggest for keeping your desk neat and school work organized?”</p><p>Answer: There is a wide range of great things on the market today to keep your desk clutter free and functional – you are only limited by your budget and your imagination! Consider increasing the surface area of your desk by placing your notes and class papers in a file cart or create a hanging file box that can fit neatly under or on the side of your desk. Organize your desk by keeping like things together or categorize by subject. Utilize a bulletin board with a calendar for important dates and project deadlines, so they won’t be missed or forgotten.</p><p>The Bedroom</p><p>Question: “Do you have any suggestions for students on how to maximize this space and still keep as much of your personal belonging in this small space?”</p><p>Answer: You can be as creative with this space as you want to be. Take advantage of the total area, including under the bed, behind the door, the walls, and even the college issued furniture. Look for wide underbed drawers; they make the perfect secondary storage unit. Hang a shoe bag behind your door; these pockets can be used for more than shoes -- socks, extra toiletries, small camera, film, batteries, water bottles, and yes even that extra case of beer. Hang a few hooks on the wall or if allowed install a small shelf. If you have a large desk, consider adding a hutch; the additional shelves are very convenient and accessible when working at the desk.</p><p>The Closet</p><p>Question: ”How do I make the most of this very small space?”</p><p>Answer: Years ago my first dorm closet was about 3 feet wide and 9 feet tall. An extremely narrow area in which to cram 9 months worth of clothes and shoes and remember this was the time in my life when I agonized over every clothing detail. Today that limited area would be a snap, because my “mom uniform” does not require a lot of space.</p><p>Seriously, most of the time closet space comes is at a premium, so you must utilize every inch. The right type of hangers is key – an item like a multi-tiered shirt or pants hanger can save space and have clothes fit neatly in small spaces. Consider adding another rod for short hang items since most college wardrobes are heavy on short hang pieces. Another product used to increase space and keep things from tumbling down is stacking shelves. If you prefer your sweaters and sweatshirts at eye level, use a hanging sweater bag that attaches to the closet rod. Don’t forget about the floor space -- short stacking baskets work well in this space.</p><p>Today’s college student may have a lot more organization and storage options than we did in years past, but with a small budget, some advance planning, clear lines of communication with roommates and a sense of humor, organizing their space can be easily accomplished and they can focus on what’s really important about college.

But with escalating costs, can we afford it?  Will they have to take part time jobs to stay afloat or can we supplement their financial needs with college loans?</p><p>These are just some of the questions that concerned parents and aspiring students are asking themselves nowadays. It’s hardly surprising when you look at the facts - a 51% increase in fee and tuition costs for public four year colleges and a 36% rise for private four year colleges in the last decade alone.  This, coupled with the disproportionate income increases for families likely to have college age children, means that more and more often parents or students themselves are turning to direct loans or private college loans for help.</p><p>Why do parents and students need extra help?</p><p>Every parent and family is made aware what their Expected Financial Contribution (EFC) will be to their child’s further education when they apply for a place. This is calculated minus any government grants and federal supported college loans the student will be granted. Every family has numerous financial commitments and additional support for your child throughout college could be all too much to bear if you don’t have enough savings or disposable income. But all is not lost! There are other sources of financial support available.</p><p>How can the shortfall be covered?</p><p>Additional financial support comes in all shapes and sizes. They normally take the forms of unsubsidized federal student loans, state sponsored loans and private sector college loans. It is the latter that has experienced the most significant growth over ten years (a 745% increase) and accounts for a whopping $10.5 billion of aid used to finance college education.</p><p>The private college loans available can be split into student loans or loans for the parent:</p><p>Student Loans</p><p>•	Private college loans from banks and other funding sources.</p><p>Parent Loans</p><p>•	Private education loans from banks and other funders.</p><p>•	Home equity loans to draw down equity from your property. These funds can be used to pay for college fees.</p><p>Is it all worth it?</p><p>Its all too easy for parents and students to balk at the idea of taking out college loans to enable them to further their education. The hard cash needed to see them through up to four years of study may seem impossible to raise but they just need to realize the benefits this will bring their child and America. College educated individuals earn more than secondary school leavers, they also participate in society more and their children will attain higher levels of education too.</p><p>The investment is worth it.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Peter Siu is a successful freelance writer providing valuable advice for consumers when applying online for credit cards, student credit cards as well as other personal & mortgage loans.

For most potential students there are some clear reasons why they wish to embark on university. The single best reason is that the subject area fascinates the reader. Please read our personal statement writing guide for more information and access our sample personal statements to read the best sample statements on the web. http://www.getintouni.com/Free/WritingGuide</p><p>This article will offer insight into how you should approach your personal statement.\r One of the typical complaints of Admission Officers is that student personal statements all seem the same; unfortunately, students normally read a number of sample statements on the internet and automatically write a typical personal statement from the range of available sample personal statements found on websites.</p><p>It is important to put yourself in the shoes of the Admissions Officer: why would your personal statement be unique, how are you different from the other candidates? Primarily you need to decide how you will divide your personal statement into digestible chucks. The most obvious way is to divide into paragraphs of 100 words. If you aim for between 500 and 600 words at most, it will help your admission officer when they have to read thousands of personal statements to find the perfect student.</p><p>So let’s take a look at the way your personal statement should be structured? If you spent, time analysing our sample personal statements http://www.getintouni.com/Samples you will see that each paragraph revolves around one particular incident or the subject area of study. Although the personal statement should logically flow from start to finish, none the less, unlike a book with a distinctive story running through it and building up to a climax, a personal statement is episodic in style and content so each paragraph stands out.</p><p>In planning your paragraphs, you must give the Admissions Officer a glow so they will wish to continue the next section.  To illustrate the structure, let’s take a look at the typical personal statement organisation. The first paragraph will need to be an exciting and dynamic narrative to capture the reader’s attention. The subsequent paragraphs should outline why you wish to study for your particular field followed by a compelling powerful final paragraph with strong action verbs to give your reader the final push to admit you.</p><p>You may find it helpful to prepare a brief synopsis or outline of the way you see your personal statement developing. It doesn’t have to be very long or detailed and, like most personal statements structures, you do not have to stick to it if, as you go along, you find a better route for your journey. Keep it simple and let it serve merely as a quick reminder of where you’re going. It might run like this: First memory – seeing my new baby brother in my mother’s arms. Nursing experience – volunteer in residential nursing home. Visiting the baby clinic – desires to become a midwife sufficed. Goals for the future – career ambitions.</p><p>It is important to cover whatever period you intend to include in your personal statement because time spent planning your sequence and the method you feel happiest with will undoubtedly make the actual writing that much easier for you.</p><p>The biggest problem you will find is finding the topics of discussion in your personal statement and selecting those topics you want to use and which topics you wish to leave out. Remember that with any form of writing you are practicing the art form. Get Into Uni Oxford Educated editors edit the personal statements for our customers to improve sentences and create a marketing sensation.</p><p>A while ago, I was asked to take a critical look at a personal statement, which spanned the student’s life from age two to eighteen. The personal statement made gripping reading but was far too long and the student had not been selective enough in the abundance of material she choose from. The word count ran to 1,500 words – far too long for a personal statement. The task of reducing your personal statement can be enthusiastically undertaken, but the problem is that you need to look at your original brainstormed ideas to organise your material for the selection process. The only criterion you need to apply at this stage is this incident of sufficient interest to the admission officer.</p><p>I hope that you agree a powerful beginning is of paramount importance or you will quickly lose the Admission Officers interest. Then, once having captured his or her attention, we have to make sure your personal statement ending is dramatic and in the right place. Each paragraph should be pleasing to the reader and you need to write a natural conclusion. Chekhov once said the essence of good style is simplicity. The best advice is therefore, to keep it simple.</p><p>Get Into Uni offers students personal statement editing and tips on how you can get an edge over the competition when applying for university.

How should a Christian respond to them not only to survive with a vibrant faith, but to benefit others as well?', '<p>What is happening on the campuses of secular universities across America? Thousands of Christian students are losing their faith and non-Christian students are becoming entrenched in their unbelief. Why is this happening? Have they discovered that God, in fact, does not really exist, that we live in a careening universe with no divine Pilot at the wheel? Or does something else explain this trend?</p><p><P><B>The Intellectual Challenge</b><BR> \r Christian students on a secular campus face a great intellectual challenge. The underlying principle of the university classroom is naturalism. Students find it everywhere, not just in biology, physics, anthropology, and geology, but also in chemistry, astronomy, psychology, political science, and so on. University faculties defend this pervasive naturalism in two ways: by banishment and by confrontation.</p><p><P><B>The Banishment Approach</b><BR>\r The banishment approach is, of course, the more venerable and the less aggressive of the two. A science professor will state at the beginning of the semester: "Science involves the gathering and analysis of data as the basis for forming hypotheses regarding the nature of reality. It must, therefore, exclude any reference to the supernatural as out of bounds for scientific inquiry. Whether or not God exists, or angels, fairies, pixies, goblins, or the Boogie Man is irrelevant to scientific investigation. Hold to your religious or superstitious beliefs if you want to, but don''t bring them up in this classroom. It is off the subject; we don''t have time for theological debates here."</p><p><P>Students instantly get the idea that believing in God is anti-intellectual or at least one''s faith should be compartmentalized and not allowed to spill over the transom into the science classroom. Be a believer elsewhere if you want, students learn, but come to science as a naturalist.</p><p><P>We Christians cannot accept this banishment. We have made Christ our life (Col. 3:4; Phil. 1:21), and His Lordship extends to every part of our lives. Certainly the One who created the universe at the beginning (Col. 1:16) and who even now sustains it moment by moment (Col. 1:17), has a right to enter a room where his handiwork is being examined and admired.</p><p><P>It is His macro- and micro-planning, organizing, systematizing, and engineering, after all, that makes all science possible. If we did not live in an orderly universe our scientists would be reduced to historians and statisticians who record the millions of haphazard events as they transpire, but can make no deductions, inductions, or educated guesses about what would happen next.</p><p><P><B>The Confrontation Approach</b> <BR>\r A more recent and increasingly popular approach in the university classroom is to take the creationist bull by the horns and attack belief in the God of the Bible by any possible means. This is the strategy of journals such as Creation/Evolution and The Skeptical Inquirer. Professors claim the mechanistic/materialistic explanation for origins removes all need for God. Naturalists in the classroom are not above using illogical arguments to win over their students.</p><p><P>For example, they may employ ad hominem arguments, associating belief in a Creator/Sustainer with witch-hunting, skinheads, and the Ku Klux Klan. Or they may use reductio ad absurdum arguments, such as asking how many dinosaur couples went onto the ark, or how Noah could be sure he had both male and female mosquitoes. Or they may knock down straw men, such as claiming victory if they can prove even the slightest changes occur, or limiting creationism only to those who believe the world began in 4004 BC. Or they may commit non sequiturs, such as claiming that since finches differ from one another, therefore, complex, mega-celled organisms evolved from single-celled life forms, and those from non-life.</p><p><P>Of course, we too must be cautious how we make our case, taking care to avoid the same mistakes. But it is difficult to wrestle with an opponent who refuses to fight by the rules.</p><p><P>We need Christian campus ministries because someone must stand up in our university community and affirm the biblical view of origins and of the ground and purpose for our existence.</p><p><P>The Bible clearly affirms these truths about our universe: (1) it had a beginning, all three persons of the Godhead being involved in its creation (Gen. 1:1-3; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:15-17); ( 2) at the beginning, it came into existence out of nothing (Heb. 11:3); and (3) its interdependent systems are all by God''s design and under His ongoing control (Job 38-39; Ps. 19:1-6).</p><p><P>The Bible has a name for those whose dizzying intellects lead them to atheism. Psalm 14:1 calls them fools, referring not to the Stupids, but to self-deceived rebels against God. Just to ensure that we don''t forget, the same psalm recurs as the fifty-third. Paul describes those who have given up their knowledge of God as those whose foolish hearts have become darkened and who then become arrogant (Rom. 1:21-23). In all three of these passages, the intellectual rejection of God''s existence leads to a moral rejection of God''s will (Ps. 14.3; 53:3; Rom. 1:24-32).</p><p><P><B>The Results of this Naturalism</b><BR>\r This prevailing naturalism (or anti-supernaturalism) has at least three far-reaching results. First, our college students are taught that truth is relative. Without God as the everlasting, immutable ground of all reality, truth becomes little more than one''s subjective perception of it. Those who hold to absolute truth are ridiculed and harassed.</p><p><P>In a recent speech entitled, "The Trouble with Being Open-Minded," Bruce Lockerbie said: "In today''s university environment, absolutes dissolve into absolutism and are scoffed at with contempt. Ironically, however, today''s students have been taught that some absolutes survive. Here is a sample of these campus absolutes, of which today''s students and many of their teachers are absolutely certain! (1) I think; therefore, I am [René Descartes]. (2) God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him [Friedrich Nietzsche]. (3) There are truths but no truth [Albert Camus]. (4) We have neither behind us, nor before us in a luminous realm of values, any means of justification or excuse. We are left alone, without excuse [Jean-Paul Sartre]. (5) Life is hard, then you die. [bumper sticker]."</p><p><P>Modern American campuses are similar to the ancient Athenians, whom Luke describes in Acts 17:21: [They] spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas. Since Christianity, with its beliefs and practices, is nearly 2000 years old, they believe it should be jettisoned by all who intellectually have come of age. Second, the faith of our students is challenged in and out of the classroom.</p><p><P>As the Apostle Peter anticipated, people sometimes ask students the reason for the hope that they have (1 Pet. 3:15), and our students should be prepared with a good answer. But Peter also said in 2 Pet. 3:3-4: "in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. They will say, Where is this coming he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation." This is naturalism''s doctrine of uniformitarianism, contradicted at creation itself and a myriad of times since by the catastrophes and the disasters of nature. Our students must learn the flaws in naturalism''s model so that their faith can stand firm and not erode away by wave after wave of faculty banishment or confrontational ridicule and the peer pressure from other students.</p><p><P>Third, our students are being taught that not only truth is relative, but morality is relative. Isaiah cries: "Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight" (Isa. 5:20-21).</p><p><P><B>The Deifying of Tolerance</b><BR>\r On campus, tolerance is praise as the highest virtue, and intolerance as the greatest vice. Senator Dan Coats of Indiana spoke recently on the virtue of tolerance. Quoting G. K. Chesterton: "When the world next tries persecution seriously, it will probably be under some new name," Coats stated that persecution''s new name is tolerance itself. Our students are taught not to be judgmental, which has the effect of encouraging them to have no moral judgment at all. Coats recalls that the poet Ogden Nash confessed: "Sometimes with secret pride I sigh / To think how tolerant am I / Then wonder which is really mine; / Tolerance, or a rubber spine."</p><p><P>This deifying of tolerance demonizes any who stand up for moral absolutes and who have the courage to say in love, for instance, to a homosexual, "What you are doing is wrong and is destructive both to yourself and to society." A colleague of mine told me of a Christian student we''ll call Ann, whose work at a local AIDS screening clinic brought her into daily contact with practicing homosexuals. She made up her mind to be salt and light in that place, and as a result, struck up a friendship with a lesbian we''ll call Florence."</p><p><P>After Ann was confident that Florence could sense her friendship, she asked her why she became a lesbian. "When I was growing up," Florence said, "I was always wanting to play rough, climb trees, go hunting, and other ''guy'' things like that. I wanted to be like my father a lot."</p><p><P>"That''s funny," Ann said. "I was a tomboy too. I used to follow my dad around trying to do whatever he did."</p><p><P>"You did? And you''re straight, right?"</p><p><P>"Yeah."</p><p><P>"I thought only lesbians had my experience."</p><p><P>Ann left it at that for awhile. Then, a few weeks later, when Florence was sharing about her first sexual experience (a lesbian one) and describing how strange it all felt, Ann said, "That makes sense. Maybe it''s like when I first went on a diet and had to drink Diet Coke. No one who first drinks that stuff likes it, but after awhile they get used to it, and then it doesn''t bother them anymore. Maybe gay sex is like that. At first you don''t like it, but if you keep doing it, you get used to it."</p><p><P>Florence didn''t say anything for a moment. "Yeah, maybe you''re right," she finally replied. These two conversations Ann had with Florence brought the lesbian a long way. Not yet all the way to Jesus Christ, but light years closer. If Ann had just shown "tolerance" and ignored the moral difference between her and Florence, nothing would have changed.</p><p><P>Coats says that the irony is how the virtue of tolerance has been stolen from us Christians. It''s time for us to reclaim it. We serve a God who makes his sun shine on the evil and the good and sends his rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. Into an intolerant world Jesus introduced tolerance as something revolutionary. He was branded a drunkard and a glutton and the friend of tax-collectors and sinners. Our friends in academia act as if mulitculturalism were something recently invented. But Paul announced it as the way of the Christ: There is neither Jew nor Greek, barbarian or Scythian, slave or free, male and female (Gal. 3:28; Col. 3:11).</p><p><P>No one has more experience in multiculturalism than the church, which for 2000 years has been taking the gospel to every nation and culture as it fulfills the Great Commission.</p><p><P>We Christians believe in tolerance. But our tolerance is not shallow like that of the academic community. In his speech Coats points out that tolerance has two extremes: permissiveness and persecution. Our non-Christian colleagues on campus stand on the permissiveness extreme--standing for nothing and falling for everything. They believe that Christians are at the other extreme, equating us with racists, ethnocentrists, and homophobes.</p><p><P>But we are not there. We hold Coats'' middle ground: persuasion (2 Cor. 5:11, 14-21). It is not that we try to force people into conforming to our (really, the Lord''s) standards. To the contrary, we have learned from our Master that outward conformity has little value if the heart is not in it. Rather, we try to change people''s thinking, confident that with changed hearts, their actions will follow. \r <P><HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE ALIGN=center COLOR=navy WIDTH=75%></p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="76" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Steve-Singleton_1637.jpg" border="0" alt="Steve Singleton - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p><FONT SIZE=1>Copyright © 2005 Steve Singleton, all rights reserved.</font>\r <P>Steve Singleton has written and edited several books and numerous articles on subjects of interest to Bible students.

You need to know the what, the why, the benefits and the how of the various forms of distance learning.', '<p>Whatever you want to label "learning at home" and however you want to define the latest buzz words for non-traditional education, you can find a program and method that suits your needs. Right now over 1.2 million people in the U.S. participate in some form of distance learning, with a projected expansion to 2.3 million in just a few years.</p><p>In looking at this rapidly expanding and viable form of education and training, there are a few basic things you need to consider and some decisions you need to make in order to create the environment that will best suit your needs. You need to know the what, the why, the benefits and the how of the various forms of distance learning.</p><p>Distance learning (correspondence courses) started in Europe in the 1800’s and has evolved into a multifaceted term that serves many purposes. Some of the forms of distance learning are: correspondence courses, online education, internet based education, electronic education, e-education, electronic learning, and e-learning. How these terms differ will depend upon how the institution defines and labels the programs which they offer. To simplify the whole concept, let’s say that these terms represent ways of learning away from a "brick and mortar" facility. Some distance learning and/or online programs may or may not be connected to a university or college. There are many programs that are independent and are not affiliated with any institution.</p><p>Distance learning offers a variety of paths to personal goals which include: GED, associate degrees, bachelor degrees, graduate certificates, master degrees, doctoral degrees, non-credit training courses, and others. Whether a person is seeking a degree, keeping professional skills updated, or pursuing skills for an interest area or hobby, there is a program or offering that should work.</p><p>Why are so many people turning to distance learning? What are its advantages? On a personal level look at such pros as: maintaining privacy; provides convenience; enables a flexible schedule; allows for balancing job and family obligations; working at own pace, going slowly or accelerating learning; can be less expensive; great for homebound individuals; no unnecessary travel; no formal class attendance; and can "learn while you earn." These are a few of the many things that are causing quite a number of people to take an entirely different approach to attaining knowledge/skills and/or earning a degree.</p><p>Those who advocate against an alternative of distance learning, often site the lack of socialization which is a part of a traditional type of education. However, not everyone is looking for the classroom activities, college events/parties, and the interactions that are a part of a school campus. Many of the classroom activities such as discussion and support can be achieved online. The other things that an online education will reinforce are: reading - ebooks, up to date \r references, current research; listening - through audio lectures or clips; seeing- through graphic illustrations and demonstrations; doing - assignments, quizzes, exams, research papers; and speaking/communication - through email, chats, and electronic discussions. A distance learning program can be far more than just reading and writing.</p><p>What are the requirements for becoming a part of a distance learning program? Many programs require a minimum of a GED or taking an admissions test. Usually, the process for applying will include: an application; transcripts; test scores; an essay; and letters of recommendation. The less formal the program, the less formal the requirements. There is a wide range in answering this questions. However, what is necessary for an online program is the right computer equipment with the internet connection (high speed), word processing capability; email; and multimedia player. The program you choose will provide more specific details for recommendation about equipment and software.</p><p>In choosing a program there some questions to ask as you do your research and make your selection. Ask about the following: help/support is offered; qualifications of the instructors; number of years the institution has provided services; is it an accredited program; details about the curriculum; and multimedia elements of the program. By the way, accreditation is voluntary since there is no officially sanctioned entity in existence. However, most schools considered the six regional accrediting agencies listings to be legitimate agencies. Ask if it is regionally accredited.</p><p>The last thing you need to think about is your motivation and work ethic. If you are a good reader (good reading comprehension skills) who doesn’t procrastinate and can avoid distractions, you will be a good candidate for an alternative approach to education. In this age of global education and the need for current knowledge and skills, this is a fast delivery system that will bring all the technological advancement right into your living room instantaneously. It works for more than a million people, and it can work for you.</p><p>Visit our Resource Center on Distance Learning at: http://sbmag.org/distancelearning.html</p><p>Copyright usage: No permission is needed to reproduce this story.

Exactly how do the students interact with the instructor and fellow students? Discover how technology has changed the delivery of education.', '<p>It''s no secret that more and more people are looking to the internet for a convenient way to further their education.  Online classes are a great way to obtain an accredited college degree from home and continue to work a full time job.  Many times a student can attend classes from their computer and schedule those classes around their job. Some schools allow the student to login to a class at their convenience. Imagine taking a class from the comfort of your own home and not having to deal with parking problems, child care, lunch, or transportation expenses.</p><p>You can also get an online degree from top, accredited online colleges and online schools that may not be available in your local area. An online education is also a great option for non-traditional students, the handicapped, people in remote areas, and people with a full-time job or a schedule that doesn’t allow for a traditional education.</p><p>Distance education can be delivered in several ways. We will examine two of the many ways education can be delivered via the internet.</p><p>One of the most common is through live media. In this type of online classroom, students typically login to a chat room type environment that allows not only for text chat but also live audio chat, similar to many of the popular “instant messaging” programs that are widely used today. The lecture can be heard through the computer speakers or through a set of headphones.  The students communicate with the teacher and other students by text chat or simply by talking into a PC microphone.  The teacher can also allow students to view him/her in a smaller window on the monitor via a webcam. The lecture can also be recorded and posted to the school website to allow students to listen to the lecture and review the material at a later time according to their schedule, and as many times as necessary.</p><p>This type of online class makes it necessary to be at the computer at a scheduled time each day.</p><p>One advantage to this type of online college classroom environment is the student receives live instruction with structured classes. It is well known that students working within in a structured setting have a higher probability of success of finishing their degree. An obvious disadvantage would be lack of scheduling flexibility.</p><p>Another variation of the online classroom setting involves text messages such as email and message boards. Each class may share a group mailbox or a message board system, which becomes the "electronic classroom".  The instructor generally posts lectures on the topic of study, posts the assignments, and provides discussion questions related to the topic.  The student can view lectures, notes from the instructor and other students, and assigned projects. The student can also post messages or questions to the instructor and other students.</p><p>One advantage of this system is 24 hour access to course materials and the ability to work at one''s own pace without regard to scheduling. A disadvantage would be lack of direct contact with the instructor.</p><p>In both scenarios students are expected to logon to the class site a certain number of days per week.  Students also can contact the instructor via e-mail to ask questions or receive answers. When assignments are due, students send them to the instructor online or by email, where they are graded and returned.  Students may also have access to their individual performance reports by logging in to a website where that information is posted. Test may also be taken online. Typically, online classes last five to six weeks.</p><p>Although the degree of difficulty is the same for the online classroom as in a traditional setting, the internet has broken down many barriers and is providing educational opportunities for people worldwide that were not previously thought possible.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Tim Arnold has recruited online students for <a target="_new" href="http://www.acit.com">http://www.acit.com</a> and also recruits students via his online college portals at <a target="_new" href="http://www.all-college-degrees.com">http://www.all-college-degrees.com</a> and <a target="_new" href="http://www.finding-a-college.com">http://www.finding-a-college.com</a>.</p><!--UdmComment-->');

Even the above average Christian colleges are little better than their secular counterpart because the curricula are developed under the same institutional accreditation guidelines, the same text books are used, many of the faculty were trained at secular institutions, and the family learning context is ignored.</p><p>Even the best of Christian distance education does not purposefully involve the family in the learning process, nor couple with individual family convictions, nor uses the family knowledge base, nor earns family income.

Christian people can easily learn how a family university can uniquely provide the humble, relational, and Spirit led ideal Biblical higher education for their young adults to participate in building a strong Christian family, church and culture.</p><p>The benefit of a network for learning was forseen by Ivan Illich, philosopher of the 1970s who spoke in favor of home education.  He stated that "If the networks I have described could emerge, the educational path of each student would be his own to follow, and only in retrospect would it take on the features of a recognizable program. The wise student would periodically seek professional advice: assistance to set a new goal, insight into difficulties encountered choice between possible methods. Even now, most persons would admit that the important services their teachers have rendered them are such advice or counsel, given at a chance meeting or in a tutorial.

So, you pull an all-nighter, and hope you can learn enough in four hours to pass your exam.  How can you develop study habits that actually work?', '<p>If you’re a student attending classes, you have probably experienced many moments when it was hard to make yourself settle down and study, even when an important exam was coming up.</p><p>If you’re like most students, you put off studying until the very last minute.  The night before the exam, you’ll stay up all night cramming, getting little or no sleep.  In the morning, you’ll drag yourself out of bed, psych yourself up with lots of coffee and some cigarettes, and go into the exam feeling exhausted, drained and jittery all at the same time.  You’ll find it hard to focus or think, and you’ll be cursing yourself for not starting to study sooner.</p><p>And not surprisingly, unless you’re blessed with natural brilliance, or you happen to know the subject matter extremely well, you’ll probably do terribly on the test.</p><p>If this is your typical method of studying, you already know it doesn’t work.

And what should you be doing instead if you want to get better marks?</p><p>A big problem for most people, especially those who are young students, is that life gets in the way.

Somehow we convince ourselves that putting off a tough study project can be the best way to avoid feeling overwhelmed by it.</p><p>When we are faced with a study project that seems exceptionally difficult and overwhelming, it can be to maintain a high level of interest and motivation for the duration of the learning process.</p><p>If you have been guilty of all these bad study habits, it’s not too late to learn some other habits that will work better for you.</p><p>First, remind yourself why you want to do better in your studies.  Maybe you need a good mark to get into a good college.  Maybe you want a chance at a career that will pay you well.  Always keep your end goal in mind.</p><p>You can put little cards up around your room with inspirational messages, and attractive photographs that will remind you why you want to do well in school.</p><p>If you feel very overwhelmed, you can improve your motivation and your performance by breaking up the project into smaller sections, or “chunks”.  Each time you accomplish one little bit successfully, give yourself a meaningful reward.</p><p>If you have a deadline looming, decide how much of the project you need to tackle at one time.</p><p>Let’s say you have six weeks to master the content of a difficult biology text.

You know what your assignment is.  You know how much you need to read every night.  Concentrate on the immediate task at hand.  You don’t need to feel overwhelmed by the entire book at one time.  Next, work out a system of rewards for yourself.  Give yourself a series of small rewards each time you master one chapter, and a larger reward for completing the entire book.</p><p>For rewards to work they must be immediate, and personally meaningful to you.  There is no point in rewarding yourself with a new fishing rod if you hate fishing.</p><p>Rewards don’t need to be material objects if there is something else that would really motivate and inspire you.  How about attending a special concert, or taking a special trip?  You decide.  Get creative and think of something that will spur you to take action.</p><p>It’s very important that the reward take place soon after the work has been accomplished.  This creates a sense of positive reinforcement.  Give yourself a small reward every time you finish a small part of the job, and a bigger reward when the project is completed.  If there is too long a gap between the activity and the reward, it will not have the effect of reinforcing the desired activity.</p><p>Besides motivating yourself with a series of external rewards, learn to motivate yourself internally.  Tell yourself you’re a good learner.  Tell yourself you enjoy learning.  Tell yourself you enjoy giving your brain a good work out.  Congratulate yourself for your efforts.  Tell yourself you love acquiring new knowledge, and let yourself feel a joy in learning.  Be proud of yourself for the work you do to gain more knowledge.</p><p>For information to sink into your brain and be accessible to you, you need to review it several times, and your brain needs to sleep properly for the memories to be encoded in your neurons.  You need to reduce your mental stress.  Your brain needs good nutrition and it needs to be in a peaceful, confident state.  Drugs and alcohol don’t help the process of learning.</p><p>Write out what you are learning in your own words, and find a learning buddy.  Practice explaining to someone else what you have learned.  This will increase the likelihood that your brain will remember it.</p><p>If you start to cram the night before, you are putting your brain at a big disadvantage.</p><p>You’re increasing your physical and mental stress, and you’re not giving yourself time to review the material several times.  By cutting back on your sleep, you’re not giving your brain a chance to put the information you’ve been studying into the hard drive storage of your brain.</p><p>By starting your studies early, and reviewing what you’ve learned, you have a much better chance of remembering and understanding what you need to know when you face a big exam.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Royane Real is a science educator and the author of several books on improving learning.

Hard work is usually a necessary condition for passing exams. Unfortunately it does not follow that it is a sufficient condition! Exam technique can be almost equally as important. It can make all the difference between success and failure or between poor grades and good grades.</p><p>As students, we often complain about the examination system. That is usually because we feel the pressure of an uncertain outcome. But like all systems we need to understand its mechanics in order to make it work for us.</p><p>What follows is largely concerned with exams needing written answers, rather than mathematically-based subjects.</p><p>Frustrating Examiners</p><p>This section applies as much to writing course work as to examination answers</p><p>When you consider writing essays, also consider the person who will have to read them. He/she has a psychology. Make it work for you, not against you. Most examiners do their job well and effectively but...</p><p>Exam assessors usually have a mountain of scripts to wade through. They like to get through them faster rather than slower, with relative ease rather than difficulty. When they find a script which facilitates the two former objects, they are delighted and their disposition towards the writer soars.</p><p>A great frustration is caused by having to ''.dig'' into the essay to discover whether or not the student has given a correct or acceptable answer. Sometimes this job is very difficult. The examiner has to re and reread the essay to discover what is actually being said. Sometimes an actual decision has to be made by the examiner as to whether a correct answer has, in fact, been given, because the composition is so obtuse.</p><p>Some method is needed which will avoid this situation and which will improve the examiner''s disposition towards the writer.</p><p>Writing Effectively</p><p>Writing effectively in exams is really not that difficult. There is a simple technique which can be used and adopted to virtually every type of question.</p><p>The technique is to divide your essay into three (unequal) parts:</p><p>1. An introduction</p><p>2. An expansion of 1;</p><p>3. A conslusion.</p><p>Numbers 1 and 3 are quite short and basically say the same thing except in rather different ways.</p><p>1. is critical and is a short version of the answer. This lets the examiner know immediately that you know what you are talking about. It require slight differences of emphases depending on the actual wording of the question.</p><p>For example, a question which asks something like "What are the factors which influence..." needs an introductory answer which starts something like: "The factors which influence so-and-so are... " And you mention them in descending order of importance. A question of the type: "Discuss  such-and-such..." needs an answer which starts something like: "When discussing such-and-such one needs to take account of..." and then mention the major points which you consider to be important and which you are going to discuss.</p><p>There may be other variations in the phrasing of the question, but the approach you adopt needs to be always the same: present the examiner with what is effectively a concise answer to the question. It usually takes no more than a few lines, maybe a dozen at most. He/she will jump up and down in excitement at having found someone who not only knows the answer but who can also actually make it explicit.</p><p>2. The expansion of the essay is simply a development to show that whatever you said at 1. is correct or relevant. This takes up most of the essay. Use a new paragraph for every new point. Don''t be afraid to be pedantic. End each of these paragraphs by relating what you have said directly back to the question. e.g. "Hence it can be seen that..." and so forth.</p><p>If, during the course of writing your answer, you suddenly remember a really major point which really should have come earlier, just "knit" it in as if this is where you always intended it to go. Thus: "Of course, a further point which needs to be given especially emphasis at this juncture is..." Try and make it seem the most natural place to put it. The examiner may think it better put elsewhere, but he will not usually penalise you for that</p><p>3. The conclusion will be little more than a restatement of the introduction - but you do need a conclusion. During the writing of the essay you may have thought of some other points not mentioned in the introduction. If so, be sure to mention them in the conclusion.</p><p>Read Before You Write</p><p>Always spend at least six/seven minutes out of a three hours exam reading the question paper. Read it three times. The first to get a general impression. The second to mark any question which you can reasonably attempt. The third to check that your second reading decisions were accurate - sometimes, in the face of nervous tension, they are not. This is time well spent. As an invigilator, one often groans within at seeing student grabbing their pens and beginning to write before the clock has stopped chiming the hour to commence!</p><p>Dividing Time</p><p>Unless some questions have unequal shares in the total marks possible, always divide your time equally between the questions. There are severe diminishing returns to each extra minute spent on the present question - more could be added to the overall total by going onto the next.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>As already said, don''t throw away your hard work during the year through bad or none existent exam technique. With good technique it is, in fact, possible to do rather well with skimpy knowledge (although one does not advocate the practice!), whereas it is commonplace for students to underachieve by neglecting their technique.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>About The Author</p><p>A K Whitehead</p><p>Web Site: <a href="http://www.christianword.co.uk" target="_new">www.christianword.co.uk</a>; \r <a href="mailto:akw@christianword.co.uk">akw@christianword.co.uk</a></p><p>The author has had many years experience in setting examining, marking and invigilating examinations and has used the above technique to considerable personal benefit.</p><!--UdmComment-->');

Saving money wherever possible can be the difference between the business that succeeds and the one that fails. This article represents a broad survey of things you can do, from consolidating your student loans to getting small business deals on supplies, that will help you spend less each month.</p><p><h3>Next Time You’re Online, Buy Something</h3></p><p>Billions of dollars are spent each year online. Rather than suggest that you hurry and move your business online, I’d like to suggest that you add some of your dollars and cents to those billions already spent. Companies who move operations online reduce their overhead costs and often pass on those savings to you. Computers, airplane tickets, even student loan consolidation, can be purchased or arranged online. It has been my experience that I can find almost everything I want online for less than I can find it anywhere else. Next time you’re thinking about biting the bullet and making that big purchase, spend a little time shopping around online and see if you can’t save a few dollars.</p><p><h3>Consolidate Student Loans and Get Your House in Order</h3></p><p>Chances are good that you’ve been out of school for a while, but don’t skip this paragraph. If you consolidate student loans or other financial obligations, you will typically save a great deal of money each month on your monthly payments. Running a home business often blurs the line between personal expenses and business operating costs – do yourself a favor and make sure you have your personal financial affairs taken care of before you find yourself overwhelmed with past obligations. The government might not have cared about your credit score when they gave you those student loans, but banks looking to give business loans are a whole different story. Making sure everything is taken care will keep financial doors open that, once they’re closed, are very difficult to reopen.</p><p><h3>Score One for the Little Guy</h3></p><p>Believe it not, most people want small businesses to succeed. There are a lot of people willing to give you a break on prices because you own a home business, but you might need to ask about it. Office supply retailers and computer distributors sometimes offer discount prices to registered small business owners. The savings are not always monumental, but even the smallest savings multiplied over a year or two start to add up to pretty substantial amounts. Shop around to see if the suppliers you use are willing to offer you a discount on supplies or equipment.</p><p><h3>Do Without…For a While</h3></p><p>I’m probably not the only person that drove a car that was older than I was during college, or who ate Ramen noodles more than once almost everyday. Don’t forget the lessons you learned while you were a poor college student – the same ability to make do with what you have can save you a lot of money in the long run. I had just graduated from college and I wanted to get a new computer to replace the older, though fully functional one I was using. This was before I took my own advice to consolidate student loans, so money was still pretty tight. I wanted to kick myself when I saw that the price on the computer I bought dropped $300 in three months. Some expenses are necessary and unavoidable. For everything else, look to see if you can manage with what you have for a while longer.</p><p><h3>Don’t Do It Alone</h3></p><p>Nobody likes data entry – it’s time consuming, boring, and time consuming. If you find yourself spending too much of your day punching numbers into spreadsheets, consider hiring someone or outsourcing it to another company. If you think that you can’t afford the part-time salary, do an inventory of your time and see if what you would pay someone is worth the amount of time you’ll be able to invest into the meatier matters of your business.</p><p>I know I’m risking sounding like your father giving you a lecture about money, but remember that a penny saved is a penny earned. A successful business minimizes costs while maximizing profits.\r <hr></p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p><i>Nick Smith</i> is a client account specialist with <a target="_new"      href="http://www.10xmarketing.com">10x Marketing</a> -  More <b>Visitors</b>.

Keep in mind that in order to receive a federal PLUS loan, you must be a dependent potential undergraduate at any college or university in the U.S. You also must be planning on attending college for at least half-time during the upcoming semester.

While it is not required for you to fill out the FAFSA form to receive a federal PLUS loan, be aware that you could receive thousands of dollars without even having to use your parents’ credit in the first place. Still, if you are not eligible for any other scholarships, the federal PLUS loan will enable you to receive financing for any portion of your college or university bill not covered by other financial aid (i.e. If college costs you $5000 a year and you already receive $4000 in financial aid, a PLUS loan will lend you the other $1000).

Follow these test preparation and test taking strategies to help you succeed.', '<p><b>Don’t cheat.</b> This goes without saying for 999 out of 1000 students (hopefully even more!) but cheating is not the way to score high on the SAT exam. Not only do you sacrifice your integrity and trustworthiness, you do yourself the huge disfavor of taking something you did not earn, and I guarantee that it will catch up with you sooner or later.</p><p><b>Prepare ahead of time.</b> If you fully grasp the importance of the SAT exam in determining your admission to colleges to which you will be applying, you’ll spend a little bit of time preparing before the test – and I don’t mean the day before the test. Begin a few months in advance to review concepts you know you’re having trouble with.</p><b>Study on a regular basis.</b> You’ll get a lot more mileage studying for the SAT if you set a day and time each week (or more often if you want) to study. This will also help your mind and body prepare for the test by getting them used to sitting and focusing for a long period of time.</p><p><b>Take practice exams.</b> The more you are exposed to actual exam questions, the easier time you will have dealing with the real test. Simulate the testing experience (timed, sitting in a desk, etc.) to make sure that when exam day comes around, the situation is not new to you. This will help you relax and perform to the best of your abilities.</p><p><b>Make flashcards to help you study.</b> If you play on a sports team or are involved in a school club, making flashcards can be a great way to find time to study even though you are busy. Just keep the flashcards in your backpack or sports bag and pull them out when you’re on the bus or you’re waiting for your ride. Math formulas and concepts are especially good for flashcards; so are vocabulary words.</p><p><b>Get a good night’s rest the night before the exam.</b> Going to bed before midnight might sound impossible to you, but trust me on this one. Your mind is going to be pushed and stretched to its limits during the test, so the last thing you want is for your body to be tired and groggy. Remember: early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy and wise.</p><p><b>Show up to the exam site early.</b> The SAT alone can get you pretty flustered, so the last thing you want is to show up late and not have plenty of time to get settled in and relaxed. Check the night before to make sure you have everything ready that you’re going to need in the morning. Then, when you wake up the next morning, rather than run around the house frantically looking for the things you need, you can take a nice hot shower and relax. Obviously the end goal of all of this is to make sure you’re able to do your absolute best work on the test.</p><p><b>Read all of the directions.</b> Even if you think you know what you’re supposed to do, take a few seconds to at least skim over them. Taking 20 seconds to read the directions will make you lose much less time than if you complete the section of the SAT and realize at the end you did it all wrong.</p><p><b>When you’re taking the test, don’t get bogged down on one question.</b> If you come to a question that you can’t work out right away, do not get flustered. Just skip it and come back to it. Unless you find yourself skipping a lot of questions, on the SAT it is usually best to skip the question rather than guess and then come back to it. You are penalized for every wrong answer you give, whereas leaving a question blank really has no huge impact on your score. Again, don’t leave very many questions blank as that lowers the score that you can potentially earn.</p><p><b>Review your answers with the extra time you have left at the end.</b> You might not have time to review all of the questions you had trouble with, but at least go over as many as you can. Be careful not to second-guess yourself too. It seems that more often than not our first impressions are correct, so don’t change an answer unless you have good reason to.</p><p><b>Eat ice cream.</b> But wait until after you have taken the test and done your best. Hard work and effort on your part should almost always be awarded with some kind of frozen dessert with high concentrations of sugar and fat.</p>\r\n<hr><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p><i>Nick Smith</i> is a client account specialist with <a target="_new" href="http://www.10xmarketing.com">10x Marketing</a> - More <b>Visitors</b>.

Would bringing in another country in the city, on the street, and at the business there work logically for our reader? Or would it throw our reader?</p><p>It would throw our reader.</p><p>So we need to start a new paragraph, a new (1), an ALSO/BESIDES/IN ADDITION....  For, this paragraph is of the kind Christensen calls the SUBORDINATE PARAGRAPH, and it must have an order and sub order of 1, 2, 3, 4, ....  It cannot have 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, and it cannot have a 1, 5, 2, 3, 4 order.</p><p>*****	SUBORDINATE paragraphs are good for telling stories, showing a process (or how-to) order, or moving from general to specific descriptions.  They are one of three types of paragraphs in the writing world.*****</p><p>This brings us, then, to the next type of paragraphing.  Fill in each of the blanks below with a phrase:</p><p>(1) What is truth?</p><p>(2)  Truth is_____________________________________.</p><p>(2)  It is________________________________________.</p><p>(2)  It is________________________________________.</p><p>For this kind of paragraph, called a COORDINATE PARAGRAPH, each sentence that follows the topic sentence--the (1)--cooperates with the others to define and redefine a term or terms. Once you complete your own statements defining truth, note how musical, poetic, or symmetrical (matching) the paragraph is because of the effective repetition.</p><p>*****	COORDINATE paragraphs are good for--as you likely guessed--definitions, reinforcing meaning in a delivered point, and re-defining a topic.*****</p><p>This brings us to the last of the paragraphing types, called the MIXED PARAGRAPH.  This includes all other logical and reinforcing paragraphs that contain a combination of the SUBORDINATE and the COORDINATE, while it still keeps order.  That is, for example, it can be a 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, pattern, but should not have a new 1 thrown in or an oddly placed sentence like another 2 after the 3, 3, 3, part.</p><p>To clarify and to try the numbering on already written paragraphs (if, for example, you draft first and then check order second), let''s look at the following.  Try to decipher the numbering pattern in each:</p><p>A</p><p>___I am mindful that only yesterday in Birmingham, Alabama, our children, crying out for brotherhood, were answered with fire hoses, snarling dogs and even death.  ___I am mindful that only yesterday in Philadelphia, Mississippi, young people seeking to secure the right to vote were brutalized and murdered; and only yesterday more than 40 houses of worship in the State of Mississippi alone were bombed or burned because they offered a sanctuary to those who would not accept segregation.  ___I am mindful that debilitating and grinding poverty afflicts my people and chains them to the lowest rung of the economic ladder.	\r --from Dr. Martin Luther King''s Nobel \r Prize acceptance speech, Dec. 10, 1964 [3]</p><p>The above is a sample of a _____________________paragraph.</p><p>B</p><p>___There''s nothing quite so risky as a parody movie. ___Some of them work out wonderfully, and examples like "Blazing Saddles" and "Airplane!" are two of the funniest movies ever made.  ___On the other hand, sometimes you get examples like "High School High," the new film starring Jon Lovitz and Tia Carrere. ___It''s supposed to be a spoof of the "Dangerous Minds" type of movie, where a teacher comes into an inner city high school and changes everything around.  ___Lovitz plays a teacher named Richard Clark -- get it, Dick Clark? -- who quits his job at a posh private school and takes a position at the worst public high school in the district, Marion Berry High. ___He meets the beautiful administrative assistant, played by Carrere, and the hard-nosed principal, played by Louise Fletcher. ___Yes, former Oscar-winner Louise Fletcher. Can you say, "tragic waste of talent"? I knew you could....                				\r --from Alex Lau''s Movie Magazine International review, \r October, 1996</p><p>The above is a sample of a _____________________paragraph.</p><p>C</p><p>___Technically, Carlito''s Way is a combination of the innovative and the banal. ___The camerawork is invigorating, if sometimes too exotic. ___DePalma makes good use of the steadicam during the chase sequences, and this heightens whatever tension is present. ___Jellybean Benitez, a former DJ and club manager, is the music supervisor, and his choice of about a dozen mid-seventies hits helps to establish the time-frame. ___Patrick Doyle''s score, however, is horribly out-of-place....                                                       --from James Berardinelli''s Colossus review, 1993</p><p>The above is a sample of a _____________________paragraph.</p><p>D</p><p>___Describing Tupac....  ___Shit, he was real.  ___I''ma be real for a minute, because I can''t describe someone so real without being real myself: [Tupac] was everything and nothing.  ___He was dreamful, hopeful, a leader, a rebel, a thug, a friend, a role model.  ___Just everything he did was, as Tupac once said, "a calculated step to bring me closer to my death." ___He was the hip hop Jesus.\r --from Luis Camacho''s journal entry, June 16, 2004</p><p>The above is a sample of a _____________________paragraph.</p><p>What kind of paragraph do you find A is?  If you see it as a COORDINATE, you are absolutely right!</p><p>How about B? Yep, a (well-written) SUBORDINATE.</p><p>My students are divided on C, with general consensus seeing it as either a COORDINATE, with each sentence after the first reinforcing the writer’s topic sentence or as a MIXED, with the final sentence (a 3)---or…possible a new 1?</p><p>And paragraph D?  Looks like a rich MIX of details, doesn''t it?  And the writer of D hadn''t yet done this paragraphing experiment!</p><p>End Notes</p><p>[1] Christensen, Francis.

INSERT INTO `CareerArticles` (`cat_id`, `title`, `file_name`, `author`, `short_desc`, `body`) VALUES (16, 'Writing Effective (and Requisite) Essay Openers', 'Writing-Effective-(and-Requisite)-Essay-Openers', 'Roxanne McDonald', 'The don''ts and do''s of writing introductory paragraphs for college essays.', '<p>When we write for college courses, we write for an audience other than ourselves. And it’s an audience of more than one—the professor who assigned the piece.  A good way to think of (and never forget) audience is to imagine we are writing the assignment for a popular magazine that sits in multiple copies on the shelves of an equally popular bookstore.  For each magazine sold, pretend, we get a percentage.</p><p>Our goal, then, is to have as large and widespread a readership as possible—to hook as many browsers as we can—with an effective opener (also known as an introduction).  We therefore must engage, first, before we entertain, educate, or inform.</p><p>First the Caveats and Comments on Ineffective (Bad) Openers</p><p>NO to SNORE openers – Forget burdening or alienating your readers with comments of how many people in many countries have many different ideas about life and society and all those other blah, blah, blah hard-to-wrap-the-brain-around opening commentaries…which really just send the reader off to find a more intriguing read.</p><p>NO to OBVIOUS – Similar to the snore generalizations, the obvious comments in an opener will have eyes (if not heads) rolling as readers take in the TV is mental masturbation or ads are used to manipulate us statements you can avoid--by using an old Marshall McCluhan quote or Cleo awards description, for example, instead.</p><p>NO to HYPERBOLE – Putting myself through school as a waitress, I had a number of regular customers who were writers, too, they said.  They would talk at me all through my shift, reciting their best work.  One insisted on reiterating his description of the verdant rolling hills that kissed the edges of the glistening waters at the feet of the majestic span of the Golden Gate Bridge…until I would get so mental I would fantasize about bringing the heft of the glistening glass coffee pot screaming down onto his head.  In other words, do not exaggerate.  Do not bring in heavy drama and description that will overwhelm and, again, alienate your readers.  Stick with the truth.  Stick with the openers that work.</p><p>We Use Modes for Engaging Openers...and I''m going to Use One Here, Out of Necessity...and Spite</p><p>I once read a how-to article on web content writing, on making a site that brings traffic (the attention of many).  I had already begrudgingly given in to the understanding that web content writing is very different than academic writing--it has different goals, different audiences, and different elements that lend themselves to an ''A'' piece of writing.  In fact, it is so different that to write for the web we have to unravel all we have worked to weave, have to unlearn all we have learned as college English writers.</p><p>Don''t Confuse Web Content/Writing and Academic Writing</p><p>So the writer of this article says to start web copy you skip the opener and go directly to the main point (what we in academia know as the thesis).  Okay.  This made sense, I thought, as web readers read differently: they read fast, they skim, they scan, they skip...to draw the most usable info in the shortest amount of time.  (Probably the way you are reading now, hoping I get on with the point).</p><p>-I was with Mr. Web when he explained these facts.</p><p>-I was with him as he noted the research findings that back up the rationale for sacrificing good academic exposition for web text.</p><p>-And I was there with his tips and tricks, which were great...until he went too far, editorializing about writers who actually use openers:</p><p>He claimed that writers who rely on openers don''t have "the courage" to just get to the point.  So he lost me.</p><p>Don''t Let Anyone Shame Your Learning Writing Tricks</p><p>We can adapt to just about any rhetorical style.  We can adjust our notions of what makes for good writing.  But we should balk when a how-to writer insults other methods of writing.  We should even disregard implications of cowardice as unnecessary ad hominem attacks.  False attacks.  Fallacious and floppy and frivolous teaching.  Screw that.</p><p>Readers of Academic Essay Writing Appreciate (even Prefer) a Good Opener</p><p>Openers in academic writing, whether in a creatively developed literary response or a historical survey, are imperative.  They are a gentler way of drawing in, luring our readers.  They are at first quite challenging to get right, but our mastering them--which is possible--has nothing to do with courage, which comes from the French word, "coeur," heart.  We have plenty of heart.  We''re studying English, for hell sake.</p><p>Against my wishes, then, this page opens with a declaration and gets right to the point.  At first.  But it also has a "grabber" slipped in--because we''re looking at grabbers and because, well, I can''t help it.  I want to model decent prose for you.</p><p>Samples of Effective Essay Openers by Mode/Type</p><p>Even better, I''ll share with you some samples, written by my former students (who have granted permission for the use of their work as models):</p><p>****People Love Stories.  We Love to Tell Stories.  The Narrative Opener:</p><p>Once upon a time, during the era of slavery, whites were afraid of blacks, and the "word" was born.  That''s why someone came up with the "word."  Two hundred years later around my sister''s house, the children still use this "word".  Sometimes I even hear myself say this "word."  But guess what?  I check myself and correct myself, because when you use the "word" to address someone, no matter who you are or what color you are, it is totally disrespectful.</p><p>The word: "nigger".  (1)</p><p>****To Establish Credibility, Try a Sober, Scholarly Introduction. The Statistics/Facts Opener:</p><p>By the age of forty-four, 47 percent of American women will have had an abortion.  (Day 6)  To describe this statistic as anything other than a tragedy is to deny the sanctity of human life.  The Christian abortion debate rests upon the moral and theological dimension[s] of this issue.  To examine the moral dimensions of abortion without examining the social realm is to ignore the mutually dependent relationship that surrounds this debate.  (2)</p><p>****Appealing to the Senses Lures and Keeps Readers Interested.  The Descriptive Opener:</p><p>Rain is pelting my car relentlessly as I drive home from [XXX] College.  Cars rushing on the freeway cause the water on the pavement to burst into a fine mist, surrounding each and every vehicle with a billowing sheet of opaqueness.  Finally, I arrive in front of my little two-bedroom home.  With a sigh of relief, I enter my living room.</p><p>Lately, this house has turned into a haven of safety, sheltering me as much from nature''s elements as from the unpredictable and unprovoked malevolence I experience from one of my instructors.  My dread is heightened by the fact that I appear to be the primary recipient of this teacher''s outbursts of viciousness.  Slowly, my gaze shifts across the room and comes to rest on the play I have to read for my English class.  It is Mamet''s Oleanna.  I pick up the book and soon find myself drawn into the story.  Quickly, it becomes clear to me that this play [deals with] the relationship between a teacher (John) and his student (Carol).  While both characters show evidence of an interesting variety of behaviors, John mesmerizes me to a greater degree.  I begin to wonder whether John displays symptoms of an underlying psychological disorder.  (3)</p><p>Put the Readers in the Frame, Inside the Paper.  The Direct Address Opener:</p><p>You are in the midst of a blazing inferno.  Your mind is moving at the speed of light.  Yet you are paralyzed by fear.  The silence is deafening between the confinement of the four walls.  You are no longer in control.  You wonder how the communication between the members of the family has ceased, specifically between Mother and Father.  Each passing day, only silence can be heard.  The usual chatter at the dinner table is considerably lessened.  It comes down to, "Pass the corn, please."  Or one excusing oneself from the table.  (4)</p><p>Advance Trust, Establish Authority from the Start.  The Authoritative Quote Opener:</p><p>"Generations of students have studied calculus without ever seeing its power." This statement is found in an article by K.C. Cole titled, "Bringing Calculus Down to Earth," from The Los Angeles Times.  I most certainly agree with Cole.  At one point earlier in the course of the class (calculus), I was not sure about the use of calculus and the importance of it.  Others like me, such as friends, felt the same way.  For this reason, I would assume, I am doing this research.  This research is for students like myself to realize that "there is something about calculus," as Cole states in the article....  (5)</p><p>Keep with the Traditional "Show, Don''t Tell" Lesson.  The Example Opener:</p><p>Sex is great.  To me, it is all about feelings and experiences--the feeling of flesh against flesh, the experience of orgasm after orgasm.  Sometimes, even, there is that feeling of being special, wanted, and loved.  I suppose my parents had sex.  It is not really an image I like to bring to mind.  But when my father has sex with someone other than my mom, how am I supposed to feel then?  (6)</p><p>Engage by Asking for the Readers'' Opinion and Thoughtful Participation.  The Profound Rhetorical Question Opener:</p><p>Is the play, True West, written by actor/writer Sam Shepard, a sublimation of his own sibling rivalry or a rationalization of one?  He writes of two brothers who are equal in intelligence but opposite in character.  The older brother lives by his wit and the younger by his pen.  In his unique style, Shepard uses many symbols describing the keen emotions that make up these two brothers.  He also uses metaphors that reel you, the audience, into the depths of anger, pain, and the reality of life....  (7)</p><p>Finally, the Encouragement of Effective (Good) Openers</p><p>YES to APPROPRIATE introductory material.  That is, use an opener that is relevant to your essay topic.  Use an opener that fits the material.  For example, a definition of alcoholism (which might work if you were writing a book) might be too clumsy for a cause and effect paper studying the influences of alcoholism on the family.</p><p>YES to APT openers.  Do the modes that you are best at writing.  And do what you best like doing.  Write what works for you, your audience, and your assignment.</p><p>YES, modes overlap.  A narrative opener will have descriptive details.  A quote may be combined with statistics and facts.  But instead of tripping on what the exact boundaries are between modes or types of writing passages, focus on the specifics of one type of opener as you understand it.  The rest will be bonus material that merely enhances your style.</p><p>And YES to engaging, alluring introductions that lead your readers in to the place where your thesis/opinion sits waiting to declare your bold, informed truths.  Which should never be denied or neglected…any more than your audience should be.</p><p>End Notes</p><p>(1)  Bronson, A.  "The Word."</p><p>(2)  Roncella, L.  "Judging Abortion."</p><p>(3)  Prince, U.  "Who Cares?  [A Study of Oleanna]"</p><p>(4)  Tolosa, W.  "Dark silence."</p><p>(5)  Pham, D.  "Calculus as a Necessary Tool."</p><p>(6)  Guiterrez, R.

The squeaky motor gets the oil, so you will be slick and running sleekly in a just a few days…in plenty of time to submit and relax before transferring from a community college or crossing over from high school to higher learning.</p><p>While the application and entry process is exciting, it is also rigorously demanding… when it comes to writing the prompted essays.  But instead of getting intimidated, remember, it is a process with a series of many laps around the track.  Do the steps one at a time, on time, and even ahead of time; be just as rigorous as the entry requirements are; and use the following as a checklist throughout the entire personal statement writing process, and you will create a worthy piece of writing that will smoothly slide you right into the institution of your choice.</p><p>1. Use that fine machine (your head): get ahead, start ahead.</p><p>___Start early.  If the application and essay are due in three months, start working on it in two.</p><p>2.  Start small.</p><p>___If the task seems overwhelming, choose an easy, quick, or interesting part of the task.  Then you will have a momentum that will push you forward into the larger, more time consuming tasks.  For example, you know your name, address, and (maybe) what you want to major in.  Fill out the application.</p><p>3. Read X3  before you start to build.</p><p>___The first time, read the directions and the prompt choices for the personal statement(s) you have to write as if you are reading a magazine for fun.</p><p>___The second time, read the prompt choices as if you are reading a catalog and shopping for the one (best) item (prompt).  Choose the one topic that you feel you have the most to write on, the one you like, the one you are drawn to.</p><p>___The third time, read with a highlighter or pen: highlight or underline the key words in the prompt’s introductory sentences and the key action words (those words that tell you to do something).  For example, if the prompt reads as follows, you would mark it like this [I use brackets here for highlighting]:</p><p>…Is there [anything] you would like us to know [about you or your academic record] that you have not had the opportunity to [describe] elsewhere in this application?  What is [your intended major]? [Discuss] [how your interest in the field developed] and [describe] any [experience you have had in the field] – such as volunteer work, internships and employment – and what you have gained from your involvement….</p><p>4.  Make notes…and make them visible.</p><p>___You now have the (five, here) parts to list on a big piece of paper or cardboard that you then prop up or tape up on your wall or pc.  (I always do this—tape the required points on my computer; then I can constantly refer to it as I am writing.  It keeps me on track—on topic.)</p><p>5.  Consider your audience.</p><p>___As with any writing, you decide your tone based on who will be reading the work.  In this case, you are submitting to a committee of readers who read stacks and stacks of these things.  So…</p><p>6.  Be real.  Be honest.  Be engaging.  Be positive.  Be fresh.</p><p>I know, I know.  I hate it too when someone tells me to be myself.  (Who else would I be?)  The point is to avoid pretense, avoid b.s. (lies), and avoid whining, begging, and angry, bitter, resentful tirades.\r The readers want to know who you are, how you would fit, and what you would bring to the university.</p><p>___Brainstorm a list of true details, writing them on the left side of a piece of paper.  On the right side, note next to each item how that makes you a perfect candidate for the place. (The left side is negative, too.  The right side is the balance, turning the negatives into positives.)</p><p>7.  Engage.</p><p>Granted, when we writers begin drafting, we may not necessarily begin with the opening paragraph.  We scribble the lines we remember, the body, the conclusion, topic sentences, important buzz words, or anything else that comes to mind.  But when you do get to the opener, it must be as outstanding, alluring, inviting, and original as possible.</p><p>I promise I know what I’m talking about here.  As a/an (former) Associate Professor of college English, I assisted hundreds of students with both graduate and undergraduate application packets and processes--teaching workshops on the entrance essays, tutoring students in the complete process in the colleges’ learning centers, even receiving students in my home (where they still continue to approach me for consultation and support).</p><p>So I have seen/see many students get accepted to Berkeley, Cornell, Stanford, State, and other private and public institutions—based on their essays, which I helped them to write and (ugh) rewrite using the standards and guidelines of the major institutions of higher learning (and this handy manual of caveats I have compiled over the years).  And those essays start with unique, engaging intros—that follow these tricks:</p><p>___Get rid of all abstractions (now also considered clichés in the academic arena…since they have been driven into the ground by overuse). Avoid using the “success” “achieve” “lifelong dream” terms, words, and phrases.  The panel knows you want/need these.  They expect it is a given, and would probably have group heart attacks if someone wrote he/she was applying to be unsuccessful, to achieve nothing, and to listlessly idle, having no dream whatsoever.  (Okay, you get my point, right?)</p><p>___Erase the “I am an immigrant who needs to make my parents proud” clichés.  (I promise you, this strategy is empty and useless.  I have received students needing entry essay help who are immigrants, children of immigrants, products of immigrant DNA, victims of immigrant mentality….every first draft I read started with this kind of intro.  And I’ve only helped about 500 students with this exact same opener.  Imagine the weary tsk-ing and head shaking of the board member who reads thousands!)</p><p>The bottom line is this: asking to be admitted because you experienced--and are slamming the board with--a number of boo-hoo poor me hardships is the same as going to a job interview and answering questions about what skills you bring to the job by crying that you need to feed your kids.  How does your need qualify you?  It doesn’t.</p><p>___And/or, forget the “I was neglected, abused, poor, hungry, ugly, fat…” opener.  Same lecture as above applies here, too.  Unless…</p><p>___You can turn the negative into a positive.  If you have to be real, and the victim thing is part of your story, show how that pain/struggle/torture contributed to who you are today and to what you bring to the school.  But do it later in the essay and do it in passing, in mention, in brief…and then move on.  So, how do you open a personal statement?</p><p>___ By opening the essays with a metaphor, a narrative, or appropriate facts and statistics that will make the essay(s) stand out, appeal to the board, and give those readers something interesting…you have a better chance of them saying to each other, “Hey, did you read that Joe Blow essay?” and of them putting it in the “YES” pile.</p><p>Consider this:  what running theme(s) would best represent you? For example, would you, like Helen Zhang did, use a water metaphor to represent your immigrating from a country where you were going with the flow of running your own company, then moved to a country where you started over, re-built the ship from scratch, beat the hell out of those choppy stormy seas, and are now sailing, headed for helping others to row to safe shores?</p><p>Or would you, like Celestino Garcia, use a food/feeding metaphor to show how getting your fingers broken by a cruel (and insane) uncle who then forced you to do farm work and refused to feed you has instead driven you to culinary school, to prepare lovely meals for feeding today’s children even worse off than he was without food?</p><p>Or do you prefer to open with a description, as Sarah Choi did, for example, of living in the projects, looking through a cracked window at the police lights every night you sat to do grade school homework—till one day you made it out, still keeping in mind (and writing it back in at the end of your essay) the sirens and lights and project life from whence you came, so you can, when you graduate, return to the projects and aid others in escaping the flashing lights and flashes of gunfire?</p><p>8.  You’ve got their attention.  Now make your point.  Boldly.</p><p>___Here’s where your thesis comes in.  Once you have used an original description, metaphor, statistic, fact, or definition to open, wrap up the intro with a declarative, confident statement.  For example,</p><p>“This is why I want to attend Oxford.”  will not help you make your way into Oxford.  Again, it’s obvious you want to attend/be accepted, and that’s not reason enough to be accepted.</p><p>But “With this experience, with excellent grades, with a steady volunteer record, and with a pro-active attitude, I will make dynamic, positive, and supportive contributions to the community at Oxford, and later, to the community at large.” will give you the horsepower you need to finish the essay and to get accepted.</p><p>9.  You’ve done the hard part.  Follow through to the finish.</p><p>___The body of your essay will now have the theme/line of reasoning it needs to follow.  If it helps, print the thesis in large lettering, and tape this up, too.  It is the main point you will now prove with examples of</p><p>__your g.p.a.</p><p>__your outstanding performance awards</p><p>__your volunteer experience (where, when, etc.)</p><p>__your tutoring, interning, or work-related experience</p><p>__your influences/reasons for getting into the field</p><p>__any points the prompt asks for</p><p>10. Accelerate using anything you have/know/have done.</p><p>The support (body of the essay) is most important nowadays, to give you the boost you need to compete.  For instance, a number of schools/majors are impacted.  Computers and business, for example, have students neck-and-neck in fierce competition for a seat in the department.</p><p>So when there are 500 applicants with the same 4.0 g.p.a, the same awards, and the same backgrounds and work experience, you need to use facts (no b.s., made-up stuff) that will give you the extra speed.  This is why tutoring tales help.  This is where volunteering cranks up the volume.  This is where you use what you can to race ahead.  As long as it’s truth-based.  If they ask for two letters of recommendation, send three.  If they ask for one way you will contribute to the university, give them two: you will help in the department, assisting the professors (for free); and you will tutor those struggling in a (related) subject you are fortunate to do well in.</p><p>10.  But how do you come in 1st and keep the rules of the road?</p><p>Here’s where revising, revising, and revising again comes in.  First, write all you can, all you want, all you know.

These are all worth while self improvement activities we can participate in; however it can be shown that an increase number of Americans are continuing their education after high school.  Some are returning to the online classroom after an absence of several years in order to enhance or change their career.', '<p>There are many people today from all walks of life who are getting an online college degree from home. Dollar for dollar, an online college degree or post graduate work pays off.</p><p>The quickest way to give yourself a raise is to receive your certification in an area in which you are all ready working.  Examples where board certification is pertinent include technical and vocational fields to name a few.</p><p>Sometimes an online college degree is very necessary in these instances.  In some cases you have previously learned the information required of you for these various certifications, but will need the necessary degree in order to advance in your particular field.</p><p>So, let''s discuss possible uses of a college degree via distance education. Many who are presently working in technical and vocational fields enroll in online courses to restructure and enhance their careers, and receive additional certification status.</p><p>Examples of this occur on an on-going basis. A thirty year old immigrant from South America began working as a nurse''s aid, and is presently in her second semester of training from home at an online college.</p><p>A 50 year old white male enrolled in an online technical college to study electronics when the factory in which he had worked moved to Mexico early last year.</p><p>During a downsizing exercise at a psychiatric facility in Missouri, an education staff member returned to an online virtual classroom to gain continuing units of education, and add a minor to her present degree.</p><p>Thus, you can see with the use of those brief examples that continuing education can be useful as well as critical to your intellectual growth base.</p><p>An online college degree is more important than ever for several reasons.</p><p>1.  Employers feel that we are presently in an employer''s market.  This means that they can be more selective in individuals they hire.</p><p>2. Jobs that glean more pay are more specialized.  Specialized jobs require more training/education.  This is true because these jobs require the manipulation of facts, figures, and/or technology which is often times sensitive, adaptive, or computerized.</p><p>3.  Our current jobs in the U.S. are becoming more and more service oriented.  These jobs have relatively low pay and our labeled unskilled work.  Thus, one must retool to prepare his or her self to obtain a job requiring more skill and offering more pay.</p><p>4. Finally, we have entered a global economy.  Such an economy demands higher prices for homes and automobiles without providing numerous gainful employment opportunities.</p><p>How do you know if an online college degree is for you?  First, if you lack a high school diploma, a college degree is a must.\r High school non-graduates make 25% less than starting salary employees with a high school education.</p><p>Secondly, you may presently hold a position that would pay you more if you held a degree from an online technical school or online community college. You may know this information from coworkers or acquaintances in your line of work.</p><p>Thirdly, if you are considered a non-traditional student.

Students learned and studied everyday - something that is essential for you to do if you want to be on top of your industry. This article highlights some of the benefits of continuing your education and a few of the venues available to you to continue learning about your chosen profession.<H3>Why Be Life-Long Students?</H3><P><I>Add more legitimacy to your business</I>. We have all met people with advanced degrees that, for all the years they spent as students, really aren''t worth much in the real world. But people like to know that the people they are working with know what they are doing, and more often than not education is the indicator they look for. Just because you do not have a Master''s or Ph.D. does not mean you can''t demonstrate the level of education people trust. Join professional organizations or seek certification in the industry you work with. At the very least, being able to talk the talk will go a long way in letting people know you are competent and trustworthy.<P><I>Become an industry leader in your community</I>. If you''re running a small business, it is likely that your reach does not extend beyond the local area where your business is located. The internet has gone a long way in expanding the boundaries within which you can successfully operate your business. No matter how big your business reach is, staying abreast of changes in your industry in absolutely essential to maintaining a successful home business. Continuing education can be the edge you need to become the industry leader in your area. People naturally flock to the business they trust will do the best job for the best price. <H3>Where Can I Continue Learning?</H3><P><I>Local and Community Colleges </I>likely have classes available in a field related to your profession. They are typically very willing to work with continuing students, and the classes they provide can often rival university courses. Even if you can''t find a course in the exact field that you''re working in, there are always business classes available.<P><I>Online college courses </I>often have more classes available in more diverse fields. One of their greatest advantages is that they allow students to study at their own pace and at their own convenience. Prices vary between schools, but are typically very reasonable. Courses taken online may apply toward a graduate degree.<P><I>Online articles </I>are often replete with cutting-edge information on just about every topic. A simple Google search on your chosen topic plus the word "article" can yield pages and pages of material. Take everything you read online with a grain of salt though, especially if you don''t know the qualifications of the author. Though you may not be a student in the traditional sense of the word, reading online articles can help you stay abreast of changes in your industry and get ideas for future research. <P><I>E-books</I> offer the same advantages as articles while providing more in-depth information. Authors of e-books, because of the time investment involved in writing them, usually have a higher standard of qualifications; again be cautious with how much merit you give any information without consulting more authoritative sources. E-books are typically more inexpensive than regular books; depending on your industry, they may even be free.<P><I>Industry and company websites </I>often serve as portals to huge amounts of information. The information presented often comes from scientific or statistical studies, so the level of reliability can be greater than other sources of information online. If you''re really strapped for time, finding a website you like and going there each day can save you from having to spend the time to search the internet for new information.<P>In the end, continuing students are those people who take time each day to provide the best service or product that they can.

It is a hard job developing such a paper, hopefully these guidelines will give you some hints.', '<p><b>Get motivated! (''Why do I write this paper?")</b></p><p>This is a basic question with a not-so-basic answer. In order for a job to be done well – and your dissertation paper is, in fact, a job to be performed – you should give yourself time to figure out why you will do it and get yourself motivated. No motivation – no job quality, any professional can confirm that. Here are some possible answers to the motivational question:</p><p>- Because it is a must – if you do not do it, you do not graduate;</p><p>- Because, if done with responsibility, it is an excellent opportunity to stand out from the crowd and your peers – the Marketing job market gets busier with every day;</p><p>- Because you can practice your research skills while being directed and supervised by professionals (eg. your university professors);</p><p>- Because it could be a starting point for your career.</p><p>We all know the more you think about it, the more answers you can find. Once you have your motivational level raised, you will surely want to start your paper right away.</p><p><b>Choose your subject ("What should I write about?")</b></p><p>Allow yourself plenty of time to think what subject you would like to pick for your paper. In some cases, your professors already have a list of subjects from where you can choose one but sometimes they would happily accept your own subject, providing it is of interest and you convince them of your reasons. Consider the following, before you go for a subject or another:</p><p>- "Marketing" is a broad field – which of its aspects do you feel more interested into, and more comfortable discussing about? Do you recall any particular course / chapter / subject that raised your interest at a time?</p><p>- Why would your subject be of importance and who would be your auditorium?</p><p>- Is your subject researchable? Is there any academic literature base on the subject?</p><p>- Do you think you can come up with a personal contribution to the subject?</p><p>- Do you see yourself developing that topic further on?</p><p>- Can you name at least a couple of persons who can guide you? Would they be willing to do that for you?</p><p><b>Documentation, documentation and... documentation</b></p><p>"Documentation" is a magic key for any successful paper. Student or acknowledged professional, once you made up your mind about the subject of the paper, most of your efforts will be directed (or should be directed) towards documentation. Depending on your subject, on your knowledge and your search capabilities, you might want to start with this even 1 – 2 years prior to raduation date, in order to have enough time to collect and review as much information as possible.</p><p>Major information resources: libraries, bookshops, internet, newspapers and magazines (consider subscribing to main specialized magazines in your field!), university printings, company exhibitions and presentations.</p><p><b>Build your paper</b></p><p>You do not have to review the whole documentation before you start to lay the bricks of your paper. Usually, such works are done using the "top-down" strategy, meaning you start with the major lines and then you develop the minor ones. You can compare this strategy with the action of drawing a tree: you might want first to draw the tree trunk, then the major branches, you will draw then some smaller branches growing from the big ones, and at the end you draw the leaves and flowers.</p><p>Therefore, once you are clear with the subject and the basics of your paper – the trunk of the tree, you can start organizing your chapters – the major branches. Generally, you wont have less than 3 main chapters and more than 6 – 7: remember your paper has to offer a valuable content but in the same time it has some space limits (for example you could be told not to exceed 70 pages including the appendix and graphics).</p><p>As you go on with your documentation, you will probably feel the need to reorganize the chapters and subchapters several times – this is the way of any good writing, so don''t be afraid of doing it as long as you stick to your subject and your chapters are part of a whole, "flowing" one from each other. Consult with you supervisor for any major changes, and ask directions if you feel the documentation is overwhelming, it becomes difficult to discern from the large amount of information and you feel like losing your coherency.</p><p>As a future Marketing professional, creativity is a basic skill as well as analytical thinking: you should prove them by including your own comments, opinions and conclusions upon the subject and not limit yourself to present only what other people said. Be critical to yourself and to others. Don''t be afraid to bring out your own vision – that''s what counts the most!</p><p><b>Writing style</b></p><p>Your paper is an academic piece of work, and so it should look and feel like. Give a lot of attention to your writing style:</p><p>- language issues – keep an academic and formal style, with no colloquial expressions and no slang terms. Be very precise and avoid hypes (yes, yes, we know it''s hard to do it especially when you''re a Marketing or Advertising professional-to-be) and irrational use of superlatives ("the best", "the greatest", "the most"… ).<br>For a professional look, avoid using vague expressions such as "some authors say…", be specific and precise! A common mistake is to assume some things are obvious or known: no, they''re not obvious to everyone, so you have to justify your statements (okay… except maybe if you''re saying that "1+1=2"...)</p><p>- grammar issues – nothing can cut enthusiasm for a paper more than poor spelling and grammar! Check – check – check and check again your grammar before submitting your work: make use of the grammar facilities included in the word processors, ask your friends to proofread your paper, use dictionaries and grammar books every time you''re unsure about something.</p><p>- layout and other issues: keep a professional clean simple layout, and stick to one font type (eg. Arial, Times New Roman or Verdana). Unless you''re asked to submit your paper in another layout, you might want to leave 3 cm (1,2 in) edges on both left and right side, use line spacing at 1.5 and font sizes 10 to 12 (depending on the font type) for normal text, with chapter title sized at 14. Double check your quotations to be acknowledged, and make sure the tables and drawings are numbered correctly.</p><p>Take a final look at your work and ask yourself if you''re feeling proud of it. If the answer is a strong "yes!", you’re probably ready to present it.</p><p><b>Presentation – the final torment!</b></p><p>Let''s not forget these guidelines were written especially for Marketing students. For you, the presentation of your paper should count much more than for other students, since it is a way to promote yourself and your work. If you fail at marketing your own person, how can you be successful in marketing something / someone else? This is the reason why you should dedicate a lot of time and energy to this apparently insignificant last issue.</p><p>Don''t fall into the trap of thinking that since your paper content is great, it will speak for yourself. It will not! You have to bring out the strengths of the paper and try to minimize its weaknesses, if any. Treat your paper like it is a new product that needs to be launched, and your teachers are the consumers. Make them "buy" your paper, make them enthusiastic about it!</p><p>Start your presentation with an introduction of how the paper subject attracted you, then shortly point the elements of novelty you bring in. After that, you can proceed with the content briefing: keep short and very objective. Talk loud and clear and note people''s attention level: try to keep them awake but if you see them drowsing, you can refresh the atmosphere by changing your tonality or inserting a joke.</p><p>At the end, don''t forget to conclude: a paper with no conclusion is an unfinished pointless paper!<br>Sustain your speech with a proper visual support: in most cases, a projector would do a great job. Be careful of how you build your slides: use 80% drawings and figures and only 20% text, as the human eye and brain respond much better to suggestive drawings instead of regular boring text. Pay attention to coherency: your presentation must flow and your ideas must have continuity. Practice your speech at home or in front of your friends, ask for comments and critics.</p><p><b><i>Good luck!!!</i></b></p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="72" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Otilia-Otlacan_3972.jpg" border="0" alt="Otilia Otlacan - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>Otilia Otlacan is a young certified professional with expertise in e-Marketing and e-Business, currently working as independent consultant and e-publisher.

It took them a lot of efforts and a lot of money to get Joshua through college, so my friend was carrying a heavy burden of high expectations and big responsibility. He had no excuses for failure and no right for mistakes, so he could not allow himself fail some class and spend thousands of dollars to repeat it next semester just because his writing skills weren''t good enough.</p><p>Sad, but true. The knowledge itself is no longer a valuable asset in our society, what matters is one''s degree or certification. Our society has invented the terms where grades are all that matter for education, why blame it on students after all.</p><p>Joshua would have been an empty space for an employer without his degree, no matter how smart he was in engineering. So, he needed that degree no matter what.</p><p>May be it was due to lack of self-confidence, or perhaps our English professor was too hard on us, but Joshua always had problems with his writing assignments at college. He never seemed to meet the instructions no matter how hard he tried. English was not the only problem. Other classes required a lot of writing, too.</p><p>When faced with the threat of failure, Joshua turned to other people''s help. First he asked for our advice and we tried to work out some solution for him. Unfortunately, nothing else helps to develop writing skills other than practice. But Joshua didn''t have extra time for it, so it didn''t work.</p><p>Then, he started using works of older students, since the assignments for some classes often repeated themselves every year. However, when caught once by one of our professors plagiarizing the same essay that was turned in a year before, Joshua decided it was too risky, because he could have been expelled.</p><p>Finally, when nothing else seemed to work for him, he started ordering his term papers and essays from one of those companies that offer writing services for a fee. I thought this was quite expensive, but then I learned that competition for these services is quite fierce, and some like www.Go2Essay.com or www.CustomResearchPapers.us now offer custom written papers for as low as $14.95 per page. I was against such solution of the problem, but it seemed to work just fine for Joshua.</p><p>Academic Honesty Doesn''T Pay Off</p><p>My other friend Kim was from a wealthy family of a self-made businessman, who owned everything he had to his own persistence and self-discipline. He didn''t want Kim to grow as a spoiled offspring of a wealthy family. When Kim was applying for a college, her father said that if she gets accepted, he would pay for her education, but would leave all other expenses up to her. So, Kim had to find a job when she was a freshman.</p><p>Not a big deal, when you still can count on your parents to support you. However, in Kim''s case she couldn''t afford quitting her job even if there were too many college assignments to cope with, because she wouldn''t have means to support herself otherwise. Her father didn''t care much for Kim''s grades as long as she could get through another semester. He only advised her to learn hard at those classes that she thought were interesting or useful for her future career, while the rest was permissible to skip as long as she could get a passing grade.</p><p>In her junior year Kim had finally decided that she would go in advertisement. She was very good at drawing and really enjoyed her creative design classes. When hired for one advertisement agency as a logo designer, she was soon making $15 per hour and working full-time almost always. The end of each semester was a real catastrophe for her, since she felt too much pressure from her deadlines both at work and at college.</p><p>Kim didn''t feel that there was something wrong with hiring people for writing her academic papers, which were not of particular interest or relevance to her career. However, she never cheated on her creative design assignments. She held them sacred and was truly the best student in her group.</p><p>Perhaps, it was her father''s influence, but Kim valued her time and was quite picky with how she spends it and whom she spends it with. None of Kim''s friends, including me, could tell that she was lazy or had a lot of disposable income to spend on her custom written papers. For Kim these services were the only way to ensure that she wouldn''t loose her job spending half of the day writing her paper on a subject of no relevance to her, and than turning it with no guarantee of a passing grade and no reward for her time.</p><p>At the end of each semester with so many writing assignments coming from different classes it was not just a matter of making some extra money, but a question of life and death: either she writes all assignments herself and goes broke next month, or she survives the pressure by delegating some of her essays to other people. Even if it looks like an academic dishonesty for other people, I know Kim was always honest to herself in pursuit of her goals, and after all it''s the only thing that matters.</p><p>These are just few examples of how the perception of plagiarism as a disastrous crime can be challenged if viewed from different perspective. I don''t think that plagiarism is the best solution for students and I do not defend its practice, however I do believe that the roots of plagiarism should not be looked in the nature of modern students, but instead - in the nature of modern education system, which values grades higher than knowledge and is designed to respond to the national standards rather than student needs.</p><p>Thus, plagiarism detection software may help to combat plagiarism in a short-term run, however, unless we re-evaluate and improve the existing system of education, the root of plagiarism will not be extirpated for a long-time benefit.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>About author:<br>\r Sindy Coffard is a staff writer of custom writing services company CustomResearchPapers.us  She helps high school, college and university students do their homework and writing assignments, including research papers, term papers, book reports, admission essays, etc.</p><p>Find it here : <a target="_new" href="http://www.customresearchpapers.us/whystturncrp.php5">http://www.customresearchpapers.us/whystturncrp.php5</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

By keeping it in perspective and adequately preparing, the test is very managable.', '<p>On March 12, 2005, high school juniors across the country were the first to take the new SAT I test, the standardized testing used in the college admission process.  The test is 3 hours and 45 minutes, instead of just 3 hours, and contains a third writing section.  So, the new test has three sections: Math, Critical Reading, and Writing, each scored out of 800 points, for a total of 2400 possible points.</p><p>To prepare for this test, students must realize that the test has not changed that dramatically and in some ways it is easier with the insidious and ambiguous analogies eliminated from the reading section.  The math section is a bit more challenging, but more congruent with 10th and 11th grade math.  Students should brush up on math formulas and know how to break down word problems. To be successful in the writing section, know how to write a good thesis that is logical, clear and concise.  The thesis does not have to be overly analytic or compelling, but every paragraph has to relate to the thesis.  Focus on grammar, which is a big component of the new SAT I test.  Know the difference between an adverb and a preposition.  Since the essay is handwritten, use print instead of script so that the essay is legible.  Be aware that SAT vocabulary words are very important, so know the root words, prefixes and suffixes.</p><p>Overall, learn the basic skills in writing, math and vocabulary before taking practice tests.  Tutoring is sometimes helpful to provide structure and motivate a student to prepare for the test.  The SAT tests do not measure intelligence, they merely measure how well students do on the test and rank them in comparison to other SAT test takers.  If the SAT I test is extremely challenging, consider taking the ACT test instead.  Most schools will accept the ACT test, but it is a good idea to check with the universities that you are applying to and find out which tests are required for admission. Students should take practice tests in the SAT and ACT to determine which test yields the better result.</p><p>For parents, know that students are very anxious about the test and help them in dealing with the pressure.  If your child has a learning issue and will benefit from more time, then lobby the school for extended or untimed test taking.  Play the SAT vocabulary test with your child at the dinner table or in the car.</p><p>Finally, put the test into perspective.  While it is certainly a factor for college admissions, it counts about half as much as the rigorousness of a student’s high school curriculum and grades.  So, for students who are lackluster test-takers, they should prove themselves academically by taking a challenging course load and working on grades.   Colleges are much more interested to know how students perform in the classroom over 4 years, than how they did for 4 hours on a Saturday morning.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Katherie Cohen, Ph.D. is the founder and CEO of IvyWise, a comprehensive educational consulting company. \r <a target="_new" href="http://www.ivywise.com">http://www.ivywise.com</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

However, there are steps that parents can take to help alleviate the stress and make the experience more positive.  To begin with, parents should make the process about “you” not “we” when discussing college choices, allowing the student to have a sense of empowerment or independence over the college selection and application process.</p><p>Parents should NEVER fill out applications, call schools or schedule appointments for their children with guidance counselors or admissions officers.  High School students are quite capable of doing the work necessary for “getting in” to college.  Parents should be open to the schools that their children are leaning toward and not fall into the “one school only” trap as the ultimate prize and reward.  Always remember that the emphasis is on enjoying the learning experience, not winning.  There are over 3,500 colleges in the US and only 200 of them accept fewer than _ of their applicants.</p><p>It is less important to push your child towards a prestigious school than it is to focus on the school that provides the proper match for successful learning and a meaningful college experience.  Encourage your child to research schools early and make several visits to college campuses.  Plan to accompany your child on these visits, but allow your child the freedom to explore and ask questions independently.  Be supportive and encourage your child to do mock interviews with other adults to prepare for the college visits.</p><p>If possible, begin the college planning process in the 9th grade, so that your child can proceed in “baby steps” instead of at a fast-paced schedule.

Have discussions with your family and others you trust.  \r If you have not already visited the schools on your list, now is the time.  One college applicant, Scott, visited the schools on his list only after he received his acceptance letters.  Doing so gave him a new perspective on his choices: “I had applied to the University of Wisconsin-Madison on my counselor’s recommendation.  I didn’t really think I would ever go there because it was so far away from home and I always thought of Wisconsin as a place of pastures and cows.  But when I visited, I felt at home.  The students were friendly, the classes were tough, and I had no idea Madison had such a fun night life.”</p><p>Prioritize.</p><p>Amanda, an aspiring professional dancer, knew she wanted to attend college.  She felt good about her auditions, and was thrilled to be admitted to several schools.  After narrowing down her choices to SUNY-Purchase and University of Michigan, Amanda realized she needed to learn more about each school. “I found that the reputation of the schools said that Michigan had stronger academics and SUNY had better connections to the New York dance scene, which is where I want to establish a career.  I am also really interested in literature and writing.”  Amanda had to prioritize.  She asked herself, what role did she want her artistic and academic interests to play in her life?  What was more important to her?</p><p>Be honest with yourself.</p><p>Radha, a senior from New Jersey, had narrowed down her acceptances to two schools: Boston University and University of Southern California (USC).  Both schools were a good fit, as Radha wanted a city school with a lot of options and school spirit.  After sorting out the pros and cons of each school, Radha was still stuck.  Something else was bothering her.  I asked, “If both schools were close to home, which would you choose?”  Without hesitation, Radha replied, “USC.  I just loved my visit and really loved the students I met.”  Suddenly, we had uncovered the issue that was hindering Radha: she wanted to go to USC, but she did not want to go far from home.  After our discussion, Radha talked about the issue with her family.  As an older sister with divorced parents, Radha had secretly decided she needed to stay near her younger sister whom she often looked after.  Discussing her concerns with her parents helped Radha make the brave decision to attend the school she wanted.  By looking deeper into the issue that was really troubling her—her fear of leaving home—Radha was able to make the decision that was best for her. It is important to remember that there are many factors that play into the decision of which school to attend.  Going off to college often signifies the beginning of a more adult life, so this decision can be influenced by anxieties about leaving home.</p><p>Go with your gut.</p><p>We’ve been through the rational decision-making processes like making pro and con lists and prioritizing.  However, intuition is often our best guide.  Adam, now a few years out of college, recently said, “I don’t know why exactly I chose Georgetown, but as soon as I got in I got excited.  Somehow I just knew it would be the best place for me.  And I was right.”  Pay attention to your gut.  Trust yourself.</p><p>You can’t be wrong.</p><p>Here is the good news: there is no such thing as the wrong choice.  Like any experience, college is what you make of it.  Take advantage of opportunities, choose challenging classes, become involved in your interests, and your decision will have been the right one. Chances are you will be happy at any of the schools on your list.  After all, you applied to them because you discovered they were good matches for you.  If you later find you would rather be somewhere else, you can always consider the transfer option.  But most students are happy with the choice they made, and graduates often look back, saying: “I am glad I went where I did, but I think I would have been happy and successful at many colleges.”</p><p>--Jackie Shapiro, MA IvyWise, LLC\r http://www.ivywise.com</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Jaclyn Shapiro, MA\r College Admissions Counselor\r IvyWise, LLC\r 140 W 57th Street\r New York, NY\r (212) 262-3500</p><p><a target="_new" href="http://www.ivywise.com">http://www.ivywise.com</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

The price of scholarly, peer-reviewed journals has skyrocketed in the last few years, often way out of the limited means of libraries, universities, individual scientists and scholars. A "scholarly divide" has opened between the haves (academic institutions with rich endowments and well-heeled corporations) and the haves not (all the others). Paradoxically, access to authoritative and authenticated knowledge has declined as the number of professional journals has proliferated. This is not to mention the long (and often crucial) delays in publishing research results and the shoddy work of many under-paid and over-worked peer reviewers.</p><p>The Internet was suppose to change all that. Originally, a computer network for the exchange of (restricted and open) research results among scientists and academics in participating institutions - it was supposed to provide instant publishing, instant access and instant gratification. It has delivered only partially. Preprints of academic papers are often placed online by their eager authors and subjected to peer scrutiny. But this haphazard publishing cottage industry did nothing to dethrone the print incumbents and their avaricious pricing.</p><p>The major missing element is, of course, respectability. But there are others. No agreed upon content or knowledge classification method has emerged. Some web sites (such as Suite101) use the Dewey decimal system. Others invented and implemented systems of their making. Additionally, one click publishing technology (such as Webseed''s or Blogger''s) came to be identified strictly to non-scholarly material: personal reminiscences, correspondence, articles and news.</p><p>Enter Scindex and its Academic Resource Channel. Established by academics and software experts from Bulgaria, it epitomizes the tearing down of geographical barriers heralded by the Internet. But it does much more than that. Scindex is a whole, self-contained, stand-alone, instant self-publishing and self-assembly system. Self-publishing systems do exist (for instance, Purdue University''s) - but they incorporate only certain components. Scindex covers the whole range.</p><p>Having (freely) registered as a member, a scientist or a scholar can publish their papers, essays, research results, articles and comments online. They have to submit an abstract and use Sciendex''s classification ("call") numbers and science descriptors, arranged in a massive directory available in the "RealSci Locator". The Locator can be also downloaded and used off-line and its is surprisingly user-friendly. The submission process itself is totally automated and very short.</p><p>The system includes a long series of thematic journals. These journals self-assemble, in accordance with the call numbers selected by the submitters. An article submitted with certain call numbers will automatically be included in the relevant journals.</p><p>The fly in the ointment is the absence of peer review. As the system moves from beta to commercialization, Scindex intends to address this issue by introducing a system of incentives and inducements. Reviewers will be granted "credit points" to be applied against the (paid) publication of their own papers, for instance.</p><p>Scindex is the model of things to come. Publishing becomes more and more automated and knowledge-orientated. Peer reviewed papers become more outlandishly expensive and irrelevant. Scientists and scholars are getting impatient and rebellious. The confluence of these three trends spells - at the least - the creation of a web based universe of parallel and alternative scholarly publishing.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>About The Author</p><p>Sam Vaknin is the author of "Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited" and "After the Rain - How the West Lost the East".

The structure and nature of all examination...', '<p>In modern society passing educational examinations becomes an  increasingly important and essential means to a better job and  improved living standards.</p><p>The structure and nature of all examinations are things we cannot  change to suit ourselves. Hence we need to find ways of dealing  effectively with them -  ways of making their systems and requirements actually work for us.</p><p>There are ways of doing this and the following can be successfully  used by anyone studying for any examinations because exams usually have certain key common elements.</p><p>Check Out The Syllabus As an examinee, you have to abide by certain rules and constraints. The time length of the exam, how many question you have to answer,  and so forth.</p><p>But the examiners also have to abide by certain rules - and they cannot  change them (at least not without adequate notice) any more than you can!  They have to publish a syllabus for every examination and they can only ask questions on what is contained within that syllabus. Once you know  the syllabus, you know where the starting and finishing lines are and how  far you have to run</p><p>Moreover, all parts of the syllabus are not equal: some parts of it  are more equal than others. Some topics will hardly ever be questioned while others will come up every year. Highlight the syllabus using  two colours: red, say, for those areas that come up very frequently; green for those which rarely come up. Do this only after a systematic inspection of past exam papers, as the next section will explain.</p><p>Then use a third colour to highlight those (hopefully very few) parts of the syllabus which you have really serious difficulty with. Providing these parts are not numerous, and depending on how often they  come up, it may be possible to leave them on one side. But do use sense and judgement in doing this!</p><p>Whatever You Are Studying, First Study The Exam Papers Studying past examination papers is almost as crucial as studying the  subject you have chosen!</p><p>Get hold of as many past papers as you can. The more you have the  better you will be able to discern any patterns. Draw up a grid on A4 paper. Divide the top horizontally into years - as many as you have past papers for plus one for the year in which you are going to sit the exam  					 Divide the lefthand vertical into as many subject areas as seems appropriate from your inspection of the syllabus and past exam papers. Do this very careful and only after you have become  very familiar with the exam topics. Also, make allowance for any coupling of topics because sometimes examiners like to link one topic  with another. If you have, say, a dozen past papers and a particular linking has only come up once, you are probably save to forget it. But if it has occurred, say, three or four times it needs to go down.</p><p>So now you have large set of cells, each of which relates to a particular year and to a specific topic. Place a cross in each cell for the year in which a given topic has come up. If there is a pattern, and very often there is, you will soon see it. The relative frequency with which the various topic  come up will now be easy to see.</p><p>It is not that examiners are doing a parallel kind of exercise to determine the structure of the next examination they set. They might well be unaware  of the kinds of patterns we are talking about. But examiners do have at least a mental scheduling of the relative importance of particular topics and an impression of what have been chosen recently.</p><p>Now use the spare column on the right-hand side, which relates to  the year you are going to sit the exam, to mark those subject areas which seem most likely to come up this next time. These are the ones which you need to spend extra time on. The other areas need to be  covered as well, but your projections need special care and attention.</p><p>In the case of some examinations such a pattern may not seem to emerge. But often it will. In any case, it is worth the investment of  time to find out, and whether it does or not it would be foolish not to inspect as many past papers as possible. You need to see how the questions are phrased, how they are divided, sometimes even subdivided,	 whether there are any special conditions imposed, such as papers which are divided into different sections with different lengths of time allowed for each, and so forth.</p><p>Overall, many students just seem to accept the constraints of an  examination system as a barbed wire fence they can do nothing about.  But the foregoing might just give you a set of wire cutters!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>About The Author</p><p>A K Whitehead B.A., M.Phil., Cambridge University Certificate in Religious Studies (+ many other exam successes on the way) He has also set and marked and invigilated numerous examinations.</p><p>Web Site: <a href="http://www.christianword.co.uk" target="_new">www.christianword.co.uk</a></p><p>Conditions Of Use: This article may be reproduced physically or electronically providing that it and this end statement is not altered in any way without  express permission.</p><p><a href="mailto:akw@christianword.co.uk">akw@christianword.co.uk</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

But many students are not aware of such facilities bieng offered by the government or financial institutions. Through this article we try to disseminate the information and dos and donts of education loans.', '<p>Higher education in the university gives students a chance to open up. They have a completely new world to deal with. Malcolm Forbes says, “Education''s purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one.” While basic education helps inculcate the values and beliefs in students, higher education illustrates what the real world is. While they taste the charm of independence, they also experience the bitter hardships that accost independence.</p><p>All their hardships start and end with money. Being away from parents, they will have to deal with a whole lot of financial issues. Besides the tuition fees, the students will have to make provision for rent, traveling expenses, food, books and entertainment.</p><p>These add up to a sizeable figure. The parents, already burdened with their own expenses, cannot be burdened any more. With the finances leading them to the edge, students are hardly able to concentrate on studies. Some may even contemplate suicide; while others may take resort to drug abuse.</p><p>A student loan can be a convenient option of sponsoring your studies. Student loans help the students pay off their tuition fees, along with the other living expenses, which includes lodging, books, food and other charges. The amount of loan advanced will depend on the actual requirement and the financial condition of the family.</p><p>Student loan is repayable only after one completes his/ her education and starts earning a minimum amount. The minimum earning has been increased from &#8356;10000 to &#8356;15000 with effect from April 2005. This means that until the student starts earning a minimum of &#8356;15000, the student need not pay the student loan.</p><p>The search for the student loan must go on simultaneously with the search for an academic course. This ensures that the student knows the amount of loan that he has qualified for. He can thus plan the expenses in accordance with his budget. Besides, some institutions require students to advance tuition fees within a very short notice. Any delays can result in losing opportunity of studying in a preferred institution or university. Prior search for student loan ensures that you do not lose upon an opportunity.</p><p>The amount to be repaid includes an interest element combined with the principal. Paying in cash would have ensured that no such extra payments are required. However, by not utilizing ones cash reserves for the educational expenses, you are able to use it for other important expenditures.</p><p>However, it is not easy to get student loans. Most lenders find students precarious because they are not in full time employment. Besides, banks have pegged the age limit for getting loans at 22, an age higher than the age of average students, thus disqualifying them from getting loans. Absence of credit history may also act as an impediment in their search for loans. Another reason, wrongly attributed to the age of students, is that while they take loans for educational purposes, the money is actually being squandered.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are banks and lenders who accept students as mature customers. They are ready to advance financial help to the students to sort out their finances. All student loan applications are to be routed through Local Education Authority (LEA). However, this may differ if you are undergoing different circumstances, like having dependants, bieng disabled, or engaged in some kind of social work.</p><p>Lenders will be ready to offer a better APR if the student joins a part time job. This will give a source of income, and a guarantee to the lender that the repayment will be made on time. Even getting parents to be guarantors to the loan will help getting best deals.</p><p>The student is bound to inform the student loans company or the local education authority about any relevant changes that may occur on his/ her account. these include change of name, course, national insurance number, or if the student plans to go abroad, and if the employment status changes from employed to self employed. Failure to inform the authorities about such relevant changes will incur penalties.</p><p>The loan is broken into a number of installments for convenient repayment. the repayments will start from the April following the completion of the course, whether or not the student graduates. For students who are employed and their earning is above the minimum level, the employer will deduct the repayment every month from the salary. The self employed people will have to make repayments through self assessment tax returns. Those who are employed abroad will be required to pay directly to the loan provider. Failure to keep up the repayments can lead to penalties.</p><p>There are a number of means available to the student nowadays to help them in their pursuit for higher education. It is the accumulation of skills through higher education which gives one a distinct identity. Not taking advantage of them would mean bieng one of the crowd, because there will be some who would grasp the opportunity.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Andrew baker has done his masters in finance from CPIT.

Total Learning Competency is stressed and an evaluation that is below competence or what is now a "B" has been eliminated.', '<p>After presenting these ideas at the NAREN (National At-Risk Education Network) in Wisconsin last week, I was asked to write an article that would be able to reach more people to spread the exciting word about Dr. William Glasser’s work in the area of Quality Schools.</p><p>There are many characteristics that are required in order for a school to be listed as a Quality School. There are currently 13 such schools in the country, with many more on their journey to become Quality Schools.</p><p>In a Quality School, relationships are based upon trust and respect, and all discipline problems, not incidents, have been eliminated. Total Learning Competency is stressed and an evaluation that is below competence or what is now a "B" has been eliminated. All schooling as defined by Dr. William Glasser has been replaced by useful education. All students do some Quality Work each year that is significantly beyond competence. All such work receives an "A" grade or higher, such as an "A+".</p><p>Students and staff are taught to use Choice Theory in their lives and in their work in school. Parents are encouraged to participate in study groups to become familiar with the ideas of Dr. William Glasser. Students do better on state proficiency tests and college entrance examinations. The importance of these tests is emphasized in the school. Staff, students, parents and administrators view the school as a joyful place.</p><p>All of the above criterion must be in place to be listed as a Quality School. When a school is a Quality School, the dictates of “No Child Left Behind” take care of themselves. Now, of course there will be a few children who have totally rejected school that are unreachable but for the majority, they will learn and do quality work.</p><p>The way to achieve this is to implement the three conditions of quality. First, the school and each classroom must create an environment that will meet the needs of the students, and consequently of teachers. All humans are born with five basic human needs. We have the need for survival, connection/love, power, freedom and fun/learning. This is true of students and teachers.</p><p>In order to help students meet their need for survival, the school and classroom must be safe. They must feel that they won’t be hurt physically or emotionally. When students feel safe, there is no need to threaten teachers or other students.</p><p>In order for students to satisfy their need for connection/love, they must have a relationship with the teacher and the other students. They must believe that the teacher has their best interest at heart. The more you give love and connection away, the more they come back to you.</p><p>In order to satisfy a student’s need for power, teachers must listen to and respect their students’ ideas and issues. This does not mean that teachers must agree with their students but they must at least let the students know that they are important. When students feel listened to and respected, they don’t disrespect their teachers and they tend to listen more.</p><p>For students to have freedom, they must have choices. They must not be bogged down in rules and regulations. When students have choices, they won’t have the need to create destructive choices of their own.</p><p>In school, learning should be fun. Learning is always fun when the learning is useful and the students want to learn what is being taught. Imagine students having fun learning! Isn’t that the dream of teachers everywhere? When your students are having fun, you do too.</p><p>I know this sounds like an impossible task but there are many schools doing just that with training in Dr. William Glasser’s Choice Theory. Creating a need-satisfying environment is what actually eliminates discipline problems. If someone has a legitimate, appropriate way to get his/her needs met, then there is no reason to create discipline problems.</p><p>Switching courses over to a competency-based approach is critical to the Quality School concept. Students are not permitted to get credit for less than B work and they have opportunities to improve their work until it meets the minimum standard for a B. Concepts are taught in such a way that reduces the need for memorizing facts that can be found in any encyclopedia or text.</p><p>This and more speaks to the second condition of quality that students will only be asked to do useful work. It is the teacher’s job to convince students that what they are being asked to do is useful in the real world. If you are successful in that endeavor, you will have willing students. Wouldn’t that make your job more enjoyable for you?</p><p>The final condition of quality is self-evaluation. Students are asked to grade their own work. There are two essential items that must be met in order to get accurate self-evaluations from students. First, they must have no fear that the teacher or anyone else will hurt them with an honest self-evaluation. Second, there must be a clear rubric in place that will give students a model against which to compare their own work.</p><p>Self-evaluation does not replace the need of the teacher or teacher’s aide (another student already judged to be competent in that particular area) from corroborating the student’s self-evaluation.

Way... INTRODUCTION... In June 1997, the Prime Minister of Singapore unveiled the Government’s vision of ‘Thinking Schools, Learning Nation’ (TSLN). This vision was forged to improve Singa...', '<p>The L.E.A.D.E.R. Way</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>In June 1997,the Prime Minister of Singapore unveiled the Government’s vision of ‘Thinking Schools, Learning Nation’ (TSLN). This vision was forged to improve Singapore’s education system in the light of the rapid changes around the world. The Government foresees that Singapore, with its limited natural resources, can only continue to progress by nurturing a knowledgeable workforce that is adaptable to the changes in the world economy. More importantly, the Government realized that it had to start preparing the nation for these inevitable changes by revamping the education system in accordance with the vision of TSLN.</p><p>The Ministry of Education (MOE) in Singapore, the state agency responsible for the undertaking of this vision, states the goals of TSLN as follows:</p><p>Thinking Schools ensure that we equip students with skills and knowledge and values and instincts to face future challenges, while Learning Nation aims to promote a culture of continual learning beyond the school environment. (MOE, 1998,p.16)</p><p>In order to realize the vision, the MOE has introduced changes to the curriculum, the training of teachers, assessment modes and the development of resource packages. Furthermore, all schools will have students spending at least 30% of their curriculum time accessing electronic resources and working on computers. (MOE, 1998,p.17) The changes in the curriculum include the infusion of thinking skills and the reduction in the contents of the curriculum. Schools are strongly encouraged to set up their own thinking programs and teachers are to enroll in courses to learn how to infuse thinking skills in their teaching.</p><p>With the restructuring taking place to realize the vision, most teachers fear that the changes will burden them by increasing their already-heavy workload and tight time schedule due to increased training hours. The principal, being the main disseminator of the MOE’s mission of TSLN in the school, has the unenviable task to articulate this vision to overcome the resistance to the changes especially from the school’s teachers.</p><p>The main objective of the paper is to explore the perceptions of teachers as to the effectiveness of principals in leading a change programs (in this case, a Thinking Programs). Since teachers are directly responsible for the learning outcomes of the students, their perceptions of their principals’ effectiveness and concomitant actions are vital to the success of the vision of TSLN. As part of the paper, a case study of a primary school, which has embarked on a Thinking Programs, has been carried out.</p><p>REVIEW OF LITERATURE</p><p>In the hope of improving the existing system, schools face many problems when introducing well-meaning changes. Restructuring would, inevitably, involve people within the organisation to absorb new ideas and ideals that usually result in many uncertainties (Heckman, 1990). A school’s principal, thus, has the uphill task to manage the level of resistance to change and align the staff to work towards a common vision, amidst the turbulence.</p><p>To reiterate, the author is focussing on teachers’ perceptions of their principal in leading change, more specifically, the process of creating a Thinking Programme for the school. The importance of teachers’ perception of their leaders in the success of a school has been documented in various researches. Researchers (such as Bhella, 1992) suggested that teachers’ morale is related to student achievement. And, in turn, the principal has the strongest influence on teachers’ satisfaction in the workplace. (Vanderstoepe et al, 1994) From that perspective, the teachers’ satisfaction and perceptions of the principal in leading the change process would directly have an impact on the success rate of the new programme of boosting students’ achievement.</p><p>In the process of writing, the author discussed with many teachers on what they expect their leaders to do when introducing a new programs to their schools. The author has summarized the teachers’ opinions for inclusion in this paper. Previous research and literature would be used to illuminate the factors that are critical to the success of a principal in leading a change programs. To further enhance clarity of exposition, I have presented systematically the ideas encapsulated in previous research by using the acronym of L.E.A.D.E.R as a model to elucidate the steps in leading a successful change programs in a school. The acronym of L.E.A.D.E.R stands for:</p><p>Leading by example</p><p>Empowering vision</p><p>Adaptive change</p><p>Developing people</p><p>Evaluating the system</p><p>Recharge</p><p>The above model does not try to be prescriptive or attempt to imply that it will cover all the salient factors of an effective change programme. Due to the prescribed length of the paper, the author hopes that the model will shed more light in the topic of research in a more methodical manner.</p><p>Leading by Example</p><p>In most organisations that have embarked on a change programme, one of the more common complaints by the employees is that the leader does not ‘walk the talk’. In a school, if a principal is not willing to learn and adapt to changes, there are no compelling reasons for the staff to do so. The Scout’s motto, ‘ Lead by Example’, is a major criteria of what a principal must do to succeed in leading change.</p><p>In order to create a thinking and learning organisation, principal will become researchers and designers rather than controllers and overseers. They should also be a model of learning to the rest of the organisation and encourage the staff to be life-long learners. (Senge, 1990) More importantly, a principal must not merely communicate in words, but by deeds to convince the staff that the change is happening at all levels. These build a sense of esprit de corp in the school that will help in lessening the pressures that change brings to organisations.</p><p>In short, a principal has to be perceived to be capable in leading school educational development by his or her own example. (Dunning, 1993; McHugh & McMullan, 1995) Unless the staffs are convinced, they will not work co-operatively towards the success of the change programme.</p><p>Empowering Vision</p><p>A change programme requires a change of vision. According to Kotter (1995, p.10),</p><p>“ A vision says something that clarifies the direction in which an organisation needs to move.”</p><p>The Ministry of Education developed the vision of TSLN in the middle of 1997. In the schools, banners are put up to herald the vision of TSLN and school principals were expected to align the teachers towards this shared vision for the betterment of the schools. The principals are expected to modify culture through skill in communication of the necessary shared values for a changed vision. (Campbell-Evans, 1993).</p><p>Adaptive Change</p><p>In most organisations’ change programme, the appropriate pace of change is often ignored. Most leaders are impatient to see results and thus apply unwarranted pressures on those involved in the process .In Singapore schools; such a situation is a commonplace. With the MOE’s intention of creating a world-class educational system in Singapore, many new initiatives are introduced within a short period of time. Most of the initiatives will require much time and effort of the teachers, on top of their already-heavy load. Such a situation often causes distress and the principal has to address the issues.</p><p>A good leader, therefore, must be capable of regulating the distress by sequencing and pacing the work required of the change process. Unfortunately, this is not the case in most change programme. Most leaders start new initiatives without stopping other activities or they start too many initiatives at the same time. They overwhelm and disorient the very people who need to take responsibility for the work. (Heifetz & Laurie, 1997,p.180)</p><p>Developing People</p><p>The people who are directly involved in a change programme have to be suitably trained to meet the challenges. A good principal would ensure that the staff’s potential is developed for many reasons. Firstly, if the staffs are not trained well to undertake the new responsibilities of the initiative, the programme will not be a success. Secondly, a principal who develops and empowers the staff in the concerned change programme will be more able to convince them to commit to it. By doing so, a principal can demonstrate leadership by sharing leadership with the staff in the school. Through empowering others, the principal can also elevate his/her status and power. (Blasé, 1987)</p><p>A principal can also develop the staff potential by opening up channels of communication within the school. Setting up committees and encouraging peer learning could do this. External agencies with expertise in the areas of change can also be consulted to help smoothen the process of change.</p><p>A principal who is a people developer would benefit as “ solutions to adaptive challenges reside not in the executive suite but in the collective intelligence of employees at all levels.”(Heifetz & Laurie, 1997,p.173) Thus, by doing so, the principal would have increased the level of success of the new initiative and also the hearts of his/her followers.</p><p>Evaluating the System</p><p>The principal must constantly monitor the process of a new school initiative. The initial enthusiasm that has been built up the principal may wane due to the lack of a good evaluation system .An effective evaluation system would allow the principal to see the flaws and to refine the programme due to changing circumstances. A good evaluation system for a thinking programme would consist of classroom observations on the teaching of the thinking tools and feedback from those who are involved in the change process. This includes the teachers, pupils and their parents. This is important as constant feedback allows the principal to refine the programme due to changing circumstances. (Hargreaves, 1995)</p><p>To further enhance the evaluative aspect of the programme, the principal could brainstorm with the staff on the criteria of what are considered to be desired outcomes of the new initiatives. To be more specific, an effective change leader would spell out what are the short and long-term desired results of the programme and base the evaluations on such targets. The evaluative process must be realistic and fair by including appropriate time frames for achieving them. This would calm down the fears of the teachers and to ensure that they would not resort to cosmetic measures in the process of change.</p><p>A principal must also be self-reflective and be able to take criticism if the programme is not moving according to plan. He or she must rely on the teachers who are directly involved with the pupils to give honest feedback. Though, this may raise questions of the credibility of the principal’s initial plans, a good head would allow the subordinates to point them for further improvements to a new initiative. This is especially so if the head is seeking to create a thinking and learning organisation.</p><p>Recharge</p><p>An effective evaluation system would also be used to ensure the continuing momentum of a change programme. Most change programmes may start out enthusiastically but they usually lose steam at the end. The ability to maintain the initial enthusiasm and commitment to the vision is, thus, an important criterion of an effective principal. He or she must be able to recharge the interest of the teachers by constantly reminding them and encouraging them to achieve desired outcomes. In a thinking programme, a principal could hold monthly meetings to talk about the progress and to share success stories of the programme to maintain the interest of the teachers. If the interest and enthusiasm of the staff to the initiatives can be maintained throughout, more change programmes will be successful in schools.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>During the process of writing this paper, the author felt that certain issues should be addressed. One of the main problems seems to lie in the pacing of new initiatives introduced by the Ministry of Education. Due to this, a principal is stretched for time and effort in juggling with the new initiatives. This, as shown in the case study, usually leads to other good school programmes going through a roller-coaster ride of enthusiasm. The principal would then resort to cosmetic efforts to convince the parents, visitors and the Ministry that a programme is in place as in this case study. The author hopes that this is just an isolated case but feels the Ministry should really look into the issue of whether principals are overloaded with the projects in progress before launching into another initiative.</p><p>Another issue connected to the above is the need to improve the evaluation and appraisal methods of the principals by the Ministry. At present, the evaluation tends to be inaccurate, as the Ministry does not really know the inner workings of the school. There should be a 360 degrees Feedback Survey whereby the staff (especially the teachers); pupils and parents are to evaluate the effectiveness of the principal in leading a programme. It may be considered time-consuming but it will ensure that principals do not adopt cosmetic measures to hide weaknesses of any new programmes. This also allows schools to be opened to ideas and suggestions for further refinements of the programme. In this way, the Ministry will have a more accurate picture whether the initiatives that had been introduced are articulated in a proper manner.</p><p>The author reiterates that the success of leading a change programme in schools is largely dependent on the principal’s ability to influence the perceptions of the teachers. Trust, thus, is an important ingredient that has to be built up by the principal, as the principal-teachers relationship will have an impact on other future initiatives. The paper has also included a self-evaluation questionnaire (Appendix 3) for principals who are in the process of leading a change programme in their schools. In closing, the author wants to emphasise that in order to reap the full benefits, a change programme should be nurtured and not enforced.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>About The Author</p><p>Dr.Alvin Chan is an Innovation Research Specialist in Asia.

Indeed, it is not unheard of that students can receive their degrees in as little as 2-3 years after beginning the program.</p><p>Most employers recognize online educational options the same as traditional route options, therefore students find themselves available for financial reimbursement. Tuition costs are comparable to that of the "brick and mortar" institutions.</p><p>Other online giants include: DeVry University, Westwood College, Walden University, and Kaplan University. At the same time, there are "degree mills" that offer degrees with little or no studying required in exchange for a fee.

Two years gone by and the engineers move on, perhaps they have a working prototype; perhaps not.</p><p>In Universities the professors over seeing the project exploit student labor; under grads and grad students to do the leg-work. The University’s job is to acquire the grants as fast as possible and is judged by these monies as it adds new wings and halls to the campus, thus enabling them to recruit new students in specialty niche degree programs and promote those on their website and color brochures. The Universities assign students to write papers and they write papers until their knuckles bleed about all aspects of the project, theory, math, what if scenarios, how it shoulda, coulda, woulda worked if they ever got an actual prototype working?

Students can complete this program in as little as two years, and after gaining the specified amount of work experience they will be eligible to sit the NCIDQ examination. A significant benefit of the course structure offered by Limperts Academy of Design is that home study removes international borders and many obstacles that have previously existed. One such obstacle is the cost of education in the US, where a typical 2 year college course will cost in the region of $50,000.  A similar college program in Europe will be a fraction of that cost and indeed, this HND in Interior Design is available for less than the cost of a typical semester in the US.</p><p>With financial barriers removed in this way, you have the opportunity to explore your natural talent and study while you continue to earn in your full time employment. Limperts Academy of Design also structure this particular program so that after successfully completing the first part of the program, students will be awarded a Diploma in Interior Design. This will enable you to begin building your work experience as you continue to study. The benefits of this approach are obvious and Limperts Academy are the only course provider to deliberately structure their courses this way and offer this level of flexibility. So you really can have your cake AND eat it!</p><p>Limperts Academy of Design specialise in professional design training programs that train students through home study. Their Head Office is based in Ireland and they have enrolled students in over 17 countries, helping them to achieve standards of excellence through distance learning that were previously described as “impossible”. Their commitment to providing quality training programs has resulted in unique teaching and student support systems that produce unparalleled results. Principal Maria Flynn sums up their approach, “We don’t just teach design, we encourage each and every student to access and nurture their own natural sense of flair and creativity. We also teach the technical and practical skills necessary to translate those design ideas into reality.”</p><p>If you are thinking about a career in interior design, then check out the Limperts Academy of Design  website at www.limpertsacademy.com</p><p>or if you simply want to learn from the best, then we invite you to review our prospectus and take the next step now to designing your future...</p><p>Limperts Academy of Design is quickly setting new standards in the design industry and is certainly an organisation that is worth keeping an eye on for the future.</p><p>The HND (Higher National Diploma) in Interior Design is jointly validated by Edexcel International and Limperts Academy of Design, under the BTEC framework, the 240 credits awarded equate to 60 semester credits in the USA and Canada.</p><p>If you have any queries regarding our courses please do not hesitate to contact Mr Paul Vincent, our Marketing Director at 00353 1 4925864 or Pvincent@limpertsacademy.com.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Limperts Academy of Design have enrolled students in over 17 countries, helping them to achieve standards of excellence through distance learning in Interior Design.</p><!--UdmComment-->');

Have you disconnected your cell phone just to avoid those darn creditors? Need a quick get rich scheme?  Well…maybe not that but in this article you will find some practical ways on saving money while attending your post secondary institution.</p><p><b>Books</b></p><p>College book prices have been rising along with the cost of tuition, and it is no wonder why so many students have resorted to photocopying their texts. Instead of photocopying why not buy an old edition book, all the information that you will need to know is there and you can keep that book as a reference. It’s not like the gravitational acceleration of earth is going to change with the new edition…right?</p><p>Too broke to buy book then try to find your books at the local library, not the school’s library. You will be amazed at how many books you will find at the local library, not only is it convenient but is also cheap. True, if you borrow a book for a semester it would cost you a late fee but I mean who cares right, since the $10 late fee charge is nothing when compared to $200 price tag of a new book price.</p><p>Another upcoming trend in colleges these days is the trend for students to rent their books. I guess these students probably wanted to keep their books as reference or may still need them for the following year and thought they could make some extra cash by renting them out. If you are thinking about renting then its best to rent to people that you know, and always have a legal signed document.</p><p>Always try to buy used. Many colleges now have a book buy back program, and these books can be found at the college used book room. Also, there are a ton of online book exchange sites on the net which are both free and convenient.</p><p>When to buy used & when to buy new? Good question. My rule is this, if a book is say like 4 years old then its best to buy used. The only time I recommend buying new is if the book is less than 4 years old, since it is more likely to being the latest edition, and you know for sure that the same edition is going to be used next term. This way you can sell your books for the maximum profit.</p><p><b>Food</b></p><p>Instead of buying a pop, from the local vending machine why not just buy a case of 24 to store at your locker or dorm room. You will be amazed at how much you will save when you buy in bulk.\r Another way of saving on food is to visit your friend’s fridge on a daily basis and when ever possible try to attend to any free food locations (parties, club meetings…etc) on campus.</p><p><b>Clothing</b></p><p>Instead of buying those brand new “check marked” shoes, why not save your money for something that you will really need in college (laptop, books, contraceptives). Try to visit the local thrift store and check Ebay on a daily basis, you will be amazed at how many $1 t-shirts are out there.</p><p><b>Printing & Photocopying</b></p><p>Many students save money on printing and photocopying by the use of a scanner. The student simply scans what he/she needs and emails the scanned file back to him/her self. Not only will you save money, but will also have an electronic copy of the file which you could later download to your laptop or pda. \r If you really must print then try not to use the school printing services. Most of the time these services will cost you an extra 5-10¢ per page, cents which could go towards the purchase of a new ink cartridge.</p><p><b>Money</b></p><p>Instead of using a credit card, why not only keep cash in your wallet/purse. Not only does this give an exact measure of how much cash you have at hand, and can spend, but will also avoid you from living above your means.</p><p>Apart from that you could also try finding a part time job on campus, not only will you get some extra cash but will also gain some valuable experience that you can put on your resume.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p><a target="_new" href="StudentDump.Com">StudentDump.Com: Educational Resources</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

Contrary to popular belief, that your Professor wants you to fail, the problem could stem from the fact that your email never reached him/her. Hence, the purpose of this guide is to show students how to write an effective email to their Professors.</p><p><b>The From Field</b><br>\r Always use your University or College email address when sending an email to your professor. This not only assures the professor that you are indeed a student but also avoids your email from getting put in the spam box. Many Universities and Colleges now employ a system of only allowing emails to be received from certain domains anything else (hotmail, yahoo...etc) is either automatically put in the spam box or is forwarded to the Professor as a potential spam.</p><p>Example:<br>\r Astudent@university.edu</p><p><b>The To Field</b><br>\r This is the single most important field, if you mess up in here there you can kiss your email good bye. Avoid putting the Professor’s name with the email (A Prof <aprof@university.com>), since not all emailing system can handle this format. It is always best to send your email to the Professor’s University or College account, since that is the email account that your Professor checks, or should check, the most. And again before sending the email double check to verify that email address was typed correctly.</p><p>Example:<br>\r Aprof@universtiy.edu</p><p><b>The Subject Field</b><br>\r The subject field should be of the following format:</p><p>CollegeName-CourceCode-Title-Subject</p><p>CollegeName: Is the name of your post secondary institution (America Learning College, Boston University…etc). Yes I do realize that this may seem a bit redundant but it is important. Most Professors (Usually new Professors) teach at one or more Universities and Colleges at any given term, and the email from those institutions gets forwarded to one main address, usually their ISP email address. So to keep things organized its best to write the name of the College or University in the Subject Field.</p><p>CourseCode: Is the code name of the course (MTH140, CPS124, GEF345…etc). It’s best to keep the letters Capital and no spaces between the number and letter.</p><p>Title: Over here you type in the title of your subject. (Test 1, Midterm, Exam, Assignment 5…etc)</p><p>Subject: Over here you type in what concern or problem you might have (Due Date Issue, Missed Test Issue, HW Problem #45…etc). Remember to keep it brief, no more then 5 words.</p><p>Example:<br>\r Boston College-MTH140-Assignment 4-HW Problem #45</p><p><b>The Text Body Field</b><br>\r Try to keep things simple, clean and to the point. By that I mean no 2 page emails or fancy fonts and color, remember your first priority is to convey your message not to show off your email editing skills. Start off with writing the Professors name (Prof C.Mcgill, Prof U.Stan…etc). Move on to the subject of your email, as a reminder restate the Course Code and Title Field (During the Monday’s MTH140 class you stated for Assignment 4). The next line should state the problem or concern. Remember to provide details and avoid repetitions. Its best to end the email with a salutatory statement (Thank You, Yours Truly..etc) and use your name, student number and College or University name as signature.</p><p>Example:<br>\r Prof C. Mcgill,\r During the Monday’s MTH140 class you stated for Assignment 4 question #41 to use the second derivative theorem. However, I am having trouble as to how to find the delta X? In particular, during the situation when time is 3 seconds and delta Y is 0. Do we set delta Y to Ymin and solve from there?</p><p>Thank You<br>\r _________________<br>\r Any Student<br>\r #:0101010101<br>\r Boston University</p><p><b>Things to Keep In Mind</b><br>\r - Give a minimum of one weekday for Professors to reply back, before sending another email.<br>\r - Avoid sending multiple duplicate emails at any one given time.\r - Try to send emails during weekdays and if possible during the Professors office hours.<br>\r - Try to be respectful and Professional (i.e. no offensive language, spell check…etc).<br>\r - Avoid taking out frustration by spamming the Professors email box.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p><a target="_new" href="http://www.studentdump.com">StudentDump.Com: Student Resources</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

You ask yourself, could I actually handle the stress, the sleepless nights, the solitary life style and the Exams? Well hopefully after reading this guide you might just be able to do so and perhaps without going insane or bald.</p><p>Buy a Calendar.</p><p>Yes I know what you are thinking a calendar but I don’t need a calendar. I was like that too, heck I never used my agenda through out high school, and I managed to reach here right? Wrong! This is not high school and if you miss a due date for a test or exam you can not tell your mommy to write a note. Trust me I tried. Time management skill is vital if not necessary, it helps you plan for the endless upcoming due dates of assignments and gives you a better picture of what tests to study for. A common miscomputation is that you can keep up with all your courses every week. This is impossible especially if you want any resemblance of a social life. Firstly forget the time you think you might be able to put aside during the weekday. After a long day of lectures and labs you will be too tired to do anything and its best just to get a good night sleep. So, the only real time you got to study, play and sleep is during the weekend. Hence, a Calendar will help you in deciding what course to study for, what homework or assignment to do, and if it’s really ok to get wasted that night.</p><p>Join a Study Group.</p><p>I can not emphasize the importance of study groups, especially in engineering. Study groups are not only for dummies, they also help nerds. For the dummies this is the perfect opportunity to understand the problem and to get vital input from others and for the nerds it gives an opportunity to revise and really understand the course material. For, there is no better way of studying then teaching others what you know. Apart from helping you pass the course, study groups also help to socialize us engineers. I mean you could go to library and study all by your self, achieve the top marks in class and graduate with honors but how effective of an engineer would you be in the real world? In the real world you won’t be given a list of problems to be completed in a 2 hour time period, but rather as an engineer you will be expected to work with others and on problems which rarely have fixed or single solutions.</p><p>Learn to Skip.</p><p>Astonishing as it may sound, but I think it is vital for first year students to learn when to skip their classes. I mean you can’t skip all your classes but can and in most cases must in order to pass the course. Again the problem arises from the fact that as a first year engineer you have a finite amount of time to study and in most cases the weekend period is not enough. So for the greater good you will have to skip the liberal studies lecture or the optional tutorial. I would rather see a student skip a class to study for a test then for him/her to show up for class and worry about the upcoming test or quiz later that day.</p><p>Learn From Mistakes.</p><p>I find that it is usually the high achievers in high school who are the ones who freak out when they see their first C. Rather then understanding from their mistakes they get overwhelmed and in some cases obsessed with the mark. They are continuously trying to make up the difference by attending every class, compulsively trying to get perfect on every home work assignment and are the ones who study all day in their locked rooms. \r Sure the student might get an A on his/hers first semester courses but in the long term (usually by the end of second year) the student will be too burnout and in most cases must drop out from their engineering program.</p><p>Take Time to Relax and Exercise.</p><p>I think it is vital for engineers to put aside some time to relax and exercise. Personally, I find nothing more satisfying then pounding a punching bag to vent out all the built up frustration after a hard day at school. Apart from exercising, diet also plays a major role. If you can not eat your greens and fruits, on a daily basis, then you should consider taking a multivitamin everyday. Drink more water when ever possible and try to keep your daily caffeine intake to a maximum of two cups, yes I realize it is hard especially when you are doing an all nighter.</p><p>Hopefully after reading the above hints you will manage much better in being a first year engineering student. Try to embrace your days in school and always try to get a good night sleep.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p><a target="_new" href="http://www.studentdump.com">StudentDump.Com: The Educational Search Engine</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

The person is not “crazy,” but rather just never learned appropriate ways to express intense feelings. Some of the most common ways to self-injure include cutting, burning, hitting, scratching, and pulling hair. A person who self-injures usually does so in private. She does not typically flaunt or brag about injuries.  Although some men self-injure, the behavior is more prevalent amongst women. The reasons vary. Some who self-mutilate say it helps to release pain, while others say it offers distraction from traumatic memories. For some, self-injury gives a sense of control. Others are numb to emotion, and self-injury gives them a way to feel something.</p><p>The biggest misconception is that self-injury is an attempt to commit suicide. The person in question may feel so bad that he has had suicidal thoughts, but generally the two are unrelated. In most cases, the act of self-injury is an attempt to cope with those intense feelings, not die.</p><p>Here are the warning signs of self-injury:</p><p>Compulsive need to injure oneself by cutting, burning, hitting, \r scratching, or pulling hair</p><p>Re-injuring old wounds so they don’t heal</p><p>Scarring, usually on arms, wrists, legs, abdomen, head, or chest</p><p>Attempts to hide arms or other body parts where injury occurred</p><p>Hoarding of sharp objects like razors</p><p>Person experiences a high from doing it</p><p>Consuming thoughts of self-injury, or the behavior interrupts normal daily functioning</p><p>In most cases, there is no intention of killing oneself, only to cope with or release intense feelings of pain</p><p>Usually self-injures when alone</p><p>If you experience any of these symptoms, you know that the behavior can feel all-consuming.

As difficult as it may be, do not attempt to stop or control someone’s self-injury. You are not responsible for her behavior, and by interfering with her way of coping, you could do more harm than good.

According to one expert, if your kids lack conflict resolution skills, it could end up costing you even more.', '<p>Parents, if you’re already reeling from the costs of today’s college education, take a deep breath.  According to one expert, if your kids lack conflict resolution skills, it could end up costing you even more.</p><p>“Students who can’t handle conflict run into trouble with roommates almost immediately,” said Susan Fee who is the author of My Roommate is Driving Me Crazy!  Solve Conflicts, Set Boundaries, and Survive the College Roommate From Hell (Adams Media, 2005).  “They avoid the issue rather than deal it, causing increased stress, lower grades, and additional moving and housing expenses,” said Fee, who is a licensed professional counselor.  She said students who focus only on academic success do so at the expense of other life skills.</p><p>“Some students have spent so much time studying and fitting in extracurricular activities that they never develop necessary social skills.  Well-intentioned parents have become overly-involved in their kids’ lives, planning their time, and solving their dilemmas.  By the time these kids enter college, they have no confidence in speaking up for themselves,” said Fee.</p><p>Another factor leading to trouble adjusting is a sense of entitlement.  “It’s not uncommon for students to come from homes where they had their own bedroom, bathroom, and TV,” said Fee.  “They have unreasonable expectations about having things their way.”</p><p>The bottom line for parents:  Children’s poor communication skills can hurt your wallet.  Kids who can’t get along with their roommates request single dorm rooms, which are not only more costly, but usually unavailable.  Others move off-campus, transfer to another school, or return home.  Grades can be affected by the stress causing some students to repeat entire semesters.  “The ultimate solution is for students to learn how to resolve their roommate differences rather than find ways to avoid them,” said Fee.</p><p>She offers these five tips to parents:</p><p>1.	Offer suggestions, not solutions.  Telling your child what to do, or worse, handling the problem yourself, does more harm than good.  Conflict resolution is a skill that needs to be practiced and the more you do for your kids, the longer it will take them to become confident.  Instead, help them become critical thinkers by imagining scenarios, brainstorming solutions, and considering possible outcomes and consequences.</p><p>2.	Prepare for conflict.  Students who assume things will be “perfect” get thrown for a loop when they’re not.  Conflict is inevitable because people are different.  Even best friends should expect to have differences in needs, living habits, stress levels, and communication skills.  Teach your child that conflict does not have to be negative; it’s an opportunity to be creative and learn how to problem solve.</p><p>3.	Share expectations.  Roommate contracts are popular today and many universities require them as a way to get kids talking about their expectations.  Even if your child’s school does not have formal contracts, encourage him to discuss things like sleep and study habits, bills, sharing items, cleaning, and the best times to have visitors.  Just like pre-marital counseling, the more that’s discussed upfront, the better the relationship.</p><p>4.	Encourage face-to-face conversations.  More and more, kids today would rather communicate through e-mail, IM, and text messaging rather than talking face-to-face.  Without the benefit of facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language, messages can be misunderstood.  Also, warn kids that gossiping to others instead of talking to their roommate directly only escalates the problem.</p><p>5.	Ask for help.  Residence life staff will help to mediate, as long as the student has already tried problem solving face-to-face.  (In reality, most students wait to mention there’s a problem until they want to move out, or at the first sign of trouble, they report it to their RA expecting that person to solve it.)  Campus counseling centers are also available for help if a roommate is exhibiting signs of mental illness such as depression, substance abuse, or cutting.  If nothing else, a counseling session can help your child learn to better deal with stress and find other ways to manage the situation.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="72" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Susan-Fee_2959.jpg" border="0" alt="Susan Fee - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>Susan Fee is a licensed counselor and author of, "My Roommate Is Driving Me Crazy!

Even if you all get along, it can get old fast.  Sometimes you just want a little privacy.  At the very least, you don’t want to feel like an outsider in your own room.</p><p>Whether you’re dealing with your roommate’s ever present love interest, or his obnoxious friends who “borrow” your stuff, you need to speak up.  Roommate issues like this don’t go away by ignoring them, so it’s best to be upfront and work together to reach an understanding.  Here are some tips that will help:</p><p>•	Keep an open mind.  It’s possible that your roommate has no idea there’s a problem, so don’t assume he’s trying to annoy you on purpose.</p><p>•	Pick the right time to talk.  Choose a time to speak to your roommate when the two of you can be alone.  Explain that you have nothing against the other people involved, but you feel uncomfortable having them around all the time.</p><p>•	Be assertive.  Stand up for your own rights while respecting the rights of your roommate.  You can’t control who your roommate spends time with or when, but you do have a say when it affects your time in the room.</p><p>•	Avoid accusations.  Starting your sentences with, "you," sounds like an attack and will likely make your roommate defensive, as in:  “You are being selfish.”  Instead, own your message by starting with, "I," as in:  "I''m unhappy with this situation.”</p><p>•	Set reasonable expectations.  If you leave the room every time your roommate has over a date or friend, he or she will assume nothing is wrong, and the problem will persist.  Both sides need to compromise instead of one person making all the changes.</p><p>•	Make a schedule.  Discuss times when both of you need space to study, sleep, or just be alone and agree to make those times off-limits to guests.</p><p>If you don’t like conflict, you may be tempted to avoid it by gossiping to other friends or complaining to your Resident Assistant without ever talking to your roommate first.  Going around the issue will only makes things worse!  By approaching your roommate calmly and respectfully, the two of you can work out an agreement that’s fair without things getting blown out of proportion.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="72" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Susan-Fee_2959.jpg" border="0" alt="Susan Fee - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>Susan Fee is a licensed counselor and author of the book, "My Roommate Is Driving Me Crazy!

It’s amazing how the quirky things you used to like about your best friend can begin to drive you crazy when you’re around it 24/7.  Just because you’ve been friends since grade school doesn’t mean you should live together.</p><p>In fact, rooming together can ruin a friendship if the two of you don’t discuss a few things ahead of time.  Living together is way different than hanging out a lot.  It’s a mistake to assume that everything will be fine just because you have a history.   Here are some things you and your best friend should talk about before you commit to being roomies.</p><p>Expect things to change.  College is about growing and making new friends. Only hanging out with your best friend can hold both of you back. All it takes is one, “You didn’t used to be that way,” to feel trapped.  Are you okay with your best friend spending less time with you and more time with new friends?  Talk about how you’d deal with this and if you expect to be included or not.</p><p>Set ground rules.  A roommate relationship takes friendship to a whole other level because now it involves sharing space, time, and decision-making. If you don’t establish boundaries with your friend like you would with someone you don’t know as well, it’s too easy to cross the line. You can end up feeling taken advantage of because you assumed your friend would make the same decisions as you, even though it was never discussed.  How will you handle cleaning, bills, and study time?  Is it alright to borrow clothes and other personal items?  When is it okay to have guests over?  Decide these things ahead of time so they won’t become issues later.</p><p>Make room for dating.  You may have promised to hang out together, but a cute date can change all that!  It’s hard not to feel jealous when you’re the one left out in the cold.  Does your friend expect you to leave the room whenever he or she wants alone time with a new date?  Both of you deserve to have a say in who gets private time in the room and what you think is fair.</p><p>Prepare for stress.  College can be stressful at times between the demands of studying, social pressures, working, and maybe even a little homesickness.  It can cause even the best of friends to take it out on each other.  Support one another by suggesting healthy ways to let off a little steam like exercising, going to a movie, talking, or even giving the other person a little space.</p><p>Fight Fair.  When issues come up, deal with them right away.  Don’t expect your friend to know what’s bugging you just because you’ve known each other a long time.  No one is a mind reader.  Giving the silent treatment or having IM arguments can make a semester seem like a lifetime!  Plus, it’s hard to avoid someone who is living four feet away.</p><p>Rooming with your best friend can be a positive experience, as long as both of you agree upfront how you’ll handle these situations.  It can be reassuring to room with someone who understands and accepts you, rather than starting from scratch with a person you’ve never met.  On the other hand, rooming with a different person gives you a chance to experience something totally new and possibly make another great friend.  And, if your new roomie ever gets on your nerves, you can always go visit your best friend!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="72" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Susan-Fee_2959.jpg" border="0" alt="Susan Fee - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>Susan Fee is a licensed counselor and author of the college survival guide, My Roommate Is Driving Me Crazy!

Here''s what you need to know to survive.', '<p>Are you living with your total opposite? It’s amazing how different two people sharing the same (tiny) room can be. Even the littlest things can drive you crazy after awhile! You eat Big Macs and chicken wings while your roommate swears by tofu and beans; you like Coldplay and your roommate cranks up Tim McGraw. You’re East Coast; your roommate is West Coast. Whatever your differences (and there are bound to be a few), you need to figure out what you’re willing to live with and what’s fair to ask your roommate to change.</p><p>Your roommate may have an accent that grates on your nerves, but that’s not something you can ask a person to change. It’s also not fair to expect someone to change his entire personality to suit you. It would be great if we could snap our fingers, and BAM, instant personality makeover! Not gonna happen. So, you need to separate personality traits from irritating habits. You won’t transform your roommate into your new best friend, but you can make things a lot more bearable.  Here are a few ideas:</p><p>Talk.  If something’s bugging you, bring it up in a non-defensive way rather than assume your roommate can read your mind.  Nothing can change unless you acknowledge it.  It’s possible that your roommate may not even be aware of the problem.</p><p>Focus on behavior, not personality.  It’s not reasonable to ask people to change who they are, but you can ask them to tone down how they express themselves, especially when it’s invading your turf.  So, you can’t criticize someone for being “perky,” but you can ask for someone not to talk so much while you’re studying.</p><p>Stay flexible.  It’s not your job to fix anybody else, and it helps to recognize that no one is perfect.  Be willing to look at your own behavior.  Consider what you could do differently to help the situation instead of only blaming your roommate.</p><p>Start with one pet peeve.  What can you absolutely not deal with? What do you find extremely irritating, but could live with if you had to? There are probably tons of things your roommate does that get on your nerves. But nothing kills a relationship faster than listing dozens of reasons why you don’t like a person.  Instead, both of you need to list your number one pet peeve and focus your energy on solving that first.</p><p>Consider the positives.  Before you decide that life would be better with a roommate exactly like you, think of what you could gain by living with your opposite. We’re often attracted to people who are different from us because they represent qualities we wish we possessed. If you’re shy, maybe being around a more outgoing person will force you out of your shell. When one person’s strength makes up for the other’s weakness, being opposites is an advantage.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="72" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Susan-Fee_2959.jpg" border="0" alt="Susan Fee - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>Susan Fee is a licensed counselor and author of the college survival guide, My Roommate Is Driving Me Crazy!

Sound worthwhile?  That doesn’t mean there isn’t work involved, but it’s how you accomplish the work that matters.  You can either work smarter, or keep spinning your wheels while barely hanging on to passing grades.  Follow these tips to make the most of your time and mental resources:</p><p>Establish Successful Habits.  Here’s a simple formula:  Successful habits lead to success and unsuccessful habits lead to failure.  Commit to studying by establishing a set time and place.  Eliminate distractions, turn off your cell phone and for that time period dedicate 100 percent of your energy to learning.</p><p>Get Roommate Cooperation:  Discuss with your roommate the best times for you to study.  Make that time off-limits to guests and loud distractions.</p><p>Prepare.  Read the topic chapters before the lecture.  (If you haven’t purchased the book yet, now is the time to do it!)  This will get you familiar with the material and give you an indication of what the professor thinks is most important by what is stressed in the lecture.</p><p>Take Notes.  As you read, write notes on what you think are the important points.  Then, during the lecture, use a highlighter to mark your reading notes when the professor touches on the same points.  Take new notes on material that is not in your book or that you did not already write down.</p><p>Study More Often for Less Time.  Cram sessions are the least effective way to learn and retain information.  It may sound cool to pull an all-nighter, but actually, you’re wasting your time as it prevents your brain and body from functioning at peak levels.  Break up your study sessions into 45-minute blocks with a 10-15 minute break in between.  Grab something to eat, stretch, or go for a walk.  This gives your brain a chance to absorb the material.  Of course this requires that you plan ahead instead of waiting to crack open your book the night before!</p><p>Study in Groups.  Studying with other people helps to reinforce the material by discussing, clarifying, and repeating it in your own words.  In addition, it also forces you to commit to a time and place to study since other people are counting on you.</p><p>Relate it to Real Life.  It’s much easier to digest and remember information in the context of a story or personal example than memorizing a bunch of unrelated facts.  Whenever you can, relate the material to real life.  Find examples in your personal experiences, music, books, current news stories, business, pop culture, or case studies.  Need help?  Ask your professor!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="72" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Susan-Fee_2959.jpg" border="0" alt="Susan Fee - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>Susan Fee is a licensed counselor and author of the college survival guide, "My Roommate Is Driving Me Crazy!

In most cases, it is the college’s first actual exposure to the student, and first impressions have a habit of lasting. A memorable essay contains all the student’s Kodak moments interlaced with some less than blissful adventures to create the necessary drama in the writing.</p><p>Students must begin by choosing the right topic, meaning the right topic for them, and one that will be well received by the admissions committees. The subject matter chosen and its degree of difficulty say volumes to the school about the character of the author. As the quality of the essay is dependent on the student’s ability to respond to the subject matter, making the correct choice is absolutely essential.</p><p>Students should select a most thought-provoking and stimulating subject to write about, and it helps greatly to view the task as a “we dare you to compete for the privilege of attending our school” challenge from the college. In other words, if there’s a literary masterpiece inside the student crying out to be written and read, this would be a good time to unleash it!</p><p>Students writing about their favorite anything should be passionate about it. It’s not enough just to say you love something or someone. It must be explained why in no uncertain terms. If writing about how a particular relative was admired by the student above all others, then how that person influenced the student’s life, how the student apprenticed that person or fashioned their lives in their light should be factored in.</p><p>Students often write about themselves as the subject matter is well known to them and requires no research. However, as this is certainly not the road less traveled, a necessary and serious effort is sorely needed to make the journey stand out amongst all the other students doing the same. Be it overcoming adversity or how the past summer was spent, the writing should be uniquely appealing to the reader and not the same old, same old. However, the essay should not be overwritten.</p><p>One of my students wrote about being molested when she was eight years old. She wisely chose not to go into the horror in her accounting of it, but rather focused on how she overcame being victimized. The essay was most compelling and was well received. She is now pursuing a medical career at a very prestigious West Coast university.</p><p>Students should avoid writing too vividly about any traumatizing experience. The essay can be gripping but not horrifying. Remember, the object here is to write an essay that captures the reader’s imagination and begs to be read in its entirety. Highly controversial subjects such as abortion are best avoided.</p><p>One of my honor students wrote a “Pro Life” essay and expressed her views with such intensity that reading it left me with the impression that she might be viewed as a danger to others with strong “pro choice” convictions!  At first, when I advised her to rewrite it, she flat out refused. I explained that she was losing site of her goal – to be accepted to the college and not to win points on her take of the anti-abortion issue. She finally realized the wisdom of my words when I reminded her that after she was accepted, she could protest and exercise her freedom of speech in any way she chose, but first, she had to get into the school.</p><p>Students must keep their eye on the prize and never lose sight of the main objective – getting an admission ticket!</p><p>My all-time favorite essay question is the University of Pennsylvania’s, “You’ve just written your 300 page autobiography. Tell us what’s on page 217?”  I advise students who choose this essay to go back in time five or six years (about a third of their life), recall where they were and what they were doing in that time period, and then begin writing about it.</p><p>A most effective and creative approach is to begin the page in the middle of a sentence, preferably ending the thought by leaving the reader in a quandary, i.e. “…because that’s the way it was arranged.” Remember that this is page 217 from your autobiography. Open any autobiography, or any book for that matter, to page 217. It probably won’t start with a fresh sentence or a new paragraph.  It is also important to leave the reader hanging at the end of the page, i.e. “…As he ran into the street, the car continued to…”</p><p>I often critique essays for students I counsel, but never write the essay for them. I cannot advise strongly enough against employing the services of a professional essay service or writer!  Not only is this first degree cheating, but the risk/reward ratio isn’t worth it. The admissions committees and the application readers are neither stupid nor naïve, and they’re on to that scam. Students should never take the chance of throwing their futures away for the want of a better paper!  If you’re qualified to get into college, than you’re talented enough to write your own essay.</p><p>Some years ago, a wealthy family who chose not to take my advice in this regard, did just that. They apparently felt it would be the sure-fire way for their son to get into an exclusive East Coast school. He had good grades, good SAT I scores and would have otherwise been acceptable, but his writing skills were, at best, slightly below average. So, they hired a professional, and their son was accepted to his college of choice.</p><p>After the third week in English Comp, his teacher couldn’t believe that someone with his limited writing skills could have ever been accepted. The professor went to the admissions office and reviewed the student’s application and essays. His suspicions were confirmed after reading the three much too professionally written essays that were in his file. He concluded that none of them could have been authored by the student.</p><p>The young man was summoned to the Dean’s office and confronted with the evidence. Left with no choice, he reluctantly confessed that his parents had hired a professional to do his essay writing. Consequently, he was given the option to immediately withdraw from classes – or be expelled for the fraud he had perpetrated on the school.</p><p>Students should also avoid the much too popular topics that everyone else usually writes about such as, How the death of a loved one or a pet had a profound affect on their life, or How growing up in an Italian neighborhood was difficult because they were from a different ethnic background. Growing up in the ghetto or in a refugee camp is a far better topic, because if you did, then you actually did overcome a life-challenging situation – and that will make a far more impressive essay.</p><p>Always be sure to adhere to the requirements of the essay. If a 300 to 500 word essay is asked for, don’t write 501 words! Schools often do a word count if they suspect an essay is over the limit, and students should always (I said always)  follow the instructions!</p><p>This is one of a series of articles by college admissions and financial aid expert, Reecy Aresty, based on his book, “Getting Into College And Paying For It!”  For further information or to contact him, please visit <a target="_new" href="http://www.thecollegebook.com">www.thecollegebook.com</a>.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="66" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Reecy-Aresty_4636.jpg" border="0" alt="Reecy Aresty - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>For almost three decades, financial advisor and lecturer Reecy Aresty, has helped thousands of families to protect their assets, increase their wealth, and reduce their taxes.

The criteria that must be considered before any college is applied to include:</p><p>•	Average GPA, SAT I, class rank for acceptance<br>\r •	The school should offer enough choices in the event the student changes their major<br>\r •	Size, location, Greeks, religious affiliation<br>\r •	Percentage of freshmen that return for year two<br>\r •	Percentage of freshmen that graduate in four years<br>\r •	Percentage of financial need met<br>\r •	Percentage of gift aid/self-help awarded<br>\r •	On or off campus job opportunities<br>\r •	Meal plans and dietary situations met<br>\r •	Name recognition<br>\r •	Student/teacher ratio<br>\r •	Average class size, semester or trimester<br>\r •	Percentage of professors who teach and percentage of teaching assistants<br>\r •	2 or 4-year college or university<br>\r •	Co-ed dorms<br>\r •	Freshman cars permitted<br>\r •	Handicap accessibility<br>\r •	Cost of the sheepskin</p><p>It is also recommended that you determine if the school uses a need-blind or need-sensitive admissions policy. Need-blind is a practice where the student is evaluated without any regard to family income or assets. Need-sensitive is a shameful policy used by a host of elite schools such as Duke, Emory and Stanford. These schools will admit a less than qualified rich kid in anticipation of a large contribution to their own endowment funds. In essence, the wealthy family has bought an admission ticket to a school where their student might never have otherwise been accepted!</p><p>It’s anyone’s guess how many other schools enrich their coffers in this deceitful, unprincipled manner. Duke has even been brazenly open about this policy, and I find it curious that shortly after reaching their $2 billion fund raising goal in 2003, they reduced their freshman acceptance percentage from 7.5%  to 4%.  The words of Former U.S. Representative Shirley Chisholm (D-NY) come to mind here, “When morality comes up against profit, it is seldom that profit loses.”</p><p>Parents and student(s) should make the official unofficial visit to potential schools no later than the 10th grade. Colleges are always impressed when a 9th or 10th grader pays a visit. By keeping in touch with officials you’ve met, in essence, you will have added points to both your GPA and SAT I scores by establishing a rapport.  When the time comes, administrators will be able to associate a face with your application. This helps a merely qualified student become a far more acceptable one.</p><p>However, before packing your bags and filling up the SUV with gas, make a checklist that includes the following:</p><p>Confirm that everything you plan to visit will be open and, ideally, that school is in session.  Ask plenty of questions and be an attentive listener. Consider bringing a video camera or tape recorder for your notes no matter how good your memory is. Find out who reads applications from your area and, if possible, try to meet with a reader and be sure to keep in touch with them.</p><p>Student athletes should meet with a coach or two. Listen to the school radio station and get a copy of the campus newspaper. If the student has Greek intentions, visit some frat or sorority houses. Students should check out the dorm unannounced, introduce themselves to attending students and pick their brains.</p><p>Have a snack in the cafeteria. After all, their food is what the student will be eating for the next four years! Students who have decided upon their course of study should make every effort to arrange a meeting with the head of that particular department and audit a class or two. This may require an overnight, giving the student a greater opportunity to check out the dorm.</p><p>These are some college selection websites I recommend:</p><p>•	For alternative criteria go to www.fairtest.org or call 617-864-4810.

Wells once said, “Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe,” which emphasized the importance of continued schooling. As the fate and future not only of any great nation – but the world, is dependent on the education of its youth, a far brighter light is cast upon the college application process.</p><p>It is in the application process, more than anywhere else, that the academic future of any student is determined. There is only one moment in time when the student’s stuff shows up in the admissions office – and it better shine!  Negligence in this arena leads to failure, and this cannot and must not be an option in any student’s life.</p><p>The first item that is reviewed by admission committees is the student’s transcript. It immediately determines whether or not the student is qualified. Simply put, it either contains qualifying grades and scores or it doesn’t. If not, the rest of the student’s stuff, no matter how carefully prepared or impressive – will be tossed in the waste basket!</p><p>Given the student passes round one, the next item carefully examined is the application. I strongly advise all of the families I counsel to avoid the Common Application unless the school being applied to doesn’t have it’s own form. I also highly recommend the use of Adobe Acrobat 5.0 or higher to prepare the application. In my view, the PDF file format is the most professional looking document you can submit. Using the school’s form and preparing it with Adobe silently announces the student’s intention of making a very positive first impression.</p><p>If for any reason you cannot use an application in a PDF file format, contact each school and have them send you their application packet. Be careful not to make the all-too-common mistake of trusting that sincere sounding, reassuring admissions person who promises that the application package will be mailed immediately. Leave nothing to chance. Be creative and take steps to insure that it actually does get mailed quickly. Offer your credit card to pay for a $15.00 overnight or $5.00 second day delivery.</p><p>Wherever possible, do not rely on school administrators in the application process, and keep your own thorough and accurate records for all schools applied to. Do not anticipate and rely on documentation from the schools.</p><p>Those with Adobe Acrobat should go to each school’s website, download their application, and save it on Desktop or in the My Documents folder, then complete it. Before printing it out, the application should be scrutinized as it must be submitted without a single mistake or inconsistency. The application is a test within itself, and you don’t want to lose the ballgame before you even get up to bat!  Close attention should be given to all questions so that they are answered correctly and properly.</p><p>I cannot overstate the importance of following directions! Each application must be submitted letter perfect! Be particularly careful with questions that call for a checkmark for the answer. Do not ever use an ‘X’ as that would be seen as not following instructions, and this is the most common cause of rejection! Never lose sight of the fact that the schools are knee deep in applications from qualified students and are looking for reasons to reject!</p><p>It is not necessary and definitely not recommended that you volunteer any information on questions that are marked, “Optional.” Providing the wrong optional information seriously jeopardizes the student’s chances of being accepted.  The only thing you want to provide that is optional – is a photo.</p><p>Given that you have carefully prepared the application, print it out and have at least two family members review it. Once you are certain it is mistake free, that all answers are consistent and all instructions have been followed, mail it either overnight or 2nd day with signature guarantee.</p><p>Although I am not a proponent of applying online, I have been assured by people I respect that the schools have finally mastered the problems they’ve experienced with electronic applications over the years. Nonetheless, if I were a student, I’d use the mail. The inexplicable disappearance of an application, no matter how rare, not only could cost the student acceptance to their college of choice, but the time lost resubmitting could cost families thousands of dollars in financial aid.</p><p>This is one of a series of articles by college admissions and financial aid expert, Reecy Aresty, based on his book, “Getting Into College And Paying For It!”  For further information or to contact him, please visit <a target="_new" href="http://www.thecollegebook.com">www.thecollegebook.com</a>.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="66" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Reecy-Aresty_4636.jpg" border="0" alt="Reecy Aresty - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>For almost three decades, financial advisor and lecturer Reecy Aresty, has helped thousands of families to protect their assets, increase their wealth, and reduce their taxes.

Attach a large paper clip to all of the above to ensure everything stays in the proper order, and then send the entire package overnight or 2nd day with a signature guarantee. Whew!</p><p>If by any chance you’re planning to submit the application electronically, consider this very carefully before you click the submit key. You may accidentally send the application before it’s completed, or send it with errors.  What will you do then, and how will you get a copy for your records?</p><p>I’m a firm believer in Murphy’s Law, that if anything can go wrong, it will.  No, that’s not pessimism, it’s realism. The transmission could get garbled, arrive incomplete or disappear from the face of the earth, all without your knowledge. The application could arrive with your name on the “address” line, and all the rest of your information pushed down, out of place, never to be processed!</p><p>As I said in a previous article, despite claims that all of these bugs have been exterminated, if it were my student, I’d mail it. Any risk is too much of a risk that the application will not be received, be received with errors and inconsistencies, or be received incomplete. In any case, if anything goes wrong, anything at all, whatever the excuse is, it will not be acceptable to the school and an otherwise qualified applicant will be called out on strikes before they even get up to bat!  Don’t let this happen to you!</p><p>The following actually happened to one of my students. He applied over the Internet, received an email confirmation and shortly thereafter received a hard copy acknowledging that his application would be processed.  No reason to be concerned yet.</p><p>The following April, the college sent out its letters of acceptance and rejection. His friends, who had all applied around the same time but not online, received their notices, yet he was still waiting. Just to be on the safe side, he called the admissions office, but alas, it was too late! He was politely informed that there had been an unfortunate computer glitch at the time he applied, and that his application was among several dozen that had been permanently lost!</p><p>Needless to say, the family was devastated. How such a thing could happen, how often accidents like this occur, who or what was responsible, and all of the apologies in the world make absolutely no difference whatsoever – you’re still up the creek without a paddle!  Just learn from this and act accordingly.</p><p>Another submission problem that should be mentioned here is, if for any reason you can’t make the  deadline, the student, not the parent, must call the school in advance of the deadline and give a valid reason why it will be impossible to meet it. They will almost always extend it another two or three weeks. Admissions officers are not totally without compassion.  However, I strongly suggest that the student ask for a written or email confirmation and write down the name of the person who granted the extension.  As I have said in many of my articles – leave nothing to chance!</p><p>OK. You’ve prepared all your stuff, completed all requirements, checked and re-checked that everything is letter perfect, mailed all the applications and have confirmations that everything was received by each school applied to.

Your second priority is how to pay for it.', '<p>In today’s highly competitive college admissions process, families must never lose sight of the fact that nothing is more important to parent or child than the student’s acceptance to college. Your second priority is how to pay for it.</p><p>Planning for college can begin as early as birth, and for that matter, even before birth.  Financial planning in the early years can make all the difference in the world when it comes time to have to cough up all that cash! The following are some of the best ways to save for college:</p><p>Custodial Accounts: With Uniform Gift or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act Accounts (UGMA or UTMA), parents, grandparents, etc. can each contribute up to $11,000 per student per year (2005). This money can be used for college or any other purpose. Although the money remains in the student’s name, the custodian, usually a parent, has absolute control over the account – i.e. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, savings, etc.  UGMA accounts accept cash only. UTMA accounts accept cash and property.</p><p>The Downside: UGMA and UTMA accounts are irrevocable gifts that are considered student assets. Since students have no asset protection allowance, these assets are assessed at either 25% per year at schools that employ the institutional methodology, (Ivy League and high profile private colleges), or 35% per year at all the rest that employ the federal methodology!  Therefore, this option must be used with extreme caution!</p><p>Education IRA’s a/k/a EIRA’s:  Single parents with an adjusted gross income (AGI) of up to $110,000, and joint filers with AGI’s up to $190,000, can contribute up to $2,000 annually to an EIRA. Earnings accumulate tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free without penalty to pay for a private elementary, secondary, or college education.</p><p>The Downside:  With the current limit of $2,000 (2005), fees can eat up much of the gains in the early years when balances are small. Contributions to EIRA’s are not tax deductible and all colleges consider EIRA’s student assets and apply the 25% or 35% assessment when calculating financial aid. What’s even worse is what happens when distributions are made from these accounts. Financial aid is automatically reduced dollar for dollar, because in addition to being an asset, the funds have now become a resource!  When these funds are legally repositioned outside of the financial aid formulas, then none of the money is assessed!</p><p>State Plans a/k/a 529 Plans:  Anyone can open a 529 Plan in his or her own name and designate a student as the beneficiary. Up to $50,000 ($100,000 jointly) may be contributed over five years to a maximum of $246,000. Funds grow tax-free and withdrawals since 2002 have been tax-free as well.</p><p>Downside:  Monies contributed are not tax deductible, and there is little or no control over how the funds are invested. Also, there is a 10% penalty for withdrawals not used for college, and 529 Plans can actually decrease chances for a large grant or scholarship – and that’s not all. When there are distributions from these accounts, financial aid is automatically reduced dollar for dollar! As with EIRA’s, having the funds legally repositioned elsewhere, will result in no assessment whatsoever!</p><p>Retirement Plans:  An IRA, HR10 (Keogh), Pension, SEP, 401(k), 403(b), 457 or any other qualified retirement plan should also be considered when saving for college. Such plans are not regarded as assets and are outside of the financial aid formulas. While the account value is not considered an asset, the annual contribution made is added back to the AGI for an income assessment!  The big print giveth, but the small print taketh away!</p><p>Non-Qualified Savings Plans:  These are accounts strictly set up to provide funds to be used to pay for the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) or any unanticipated college costs.  Families need to set up these accounts as early in the student’s life as possible, so there will be adequate money to pay such costs when the time comes.</p><p>Remember, by the time students enter high school, consideration should be given to reducing “high risk” investments. Never gamble with money that’s earmarked for education!  And, never lose sight of the fact that all monies saved for college in the early years will not serve their purpose unless the student prepares for and successfully completes the admissions process.</p><p>This is one of a series of articles by college admissions and financial aid expert, Reecy Aresty, based on his book, “Getting Into College And Paying For It!”  For further information or to contact him, please visit <a target="_new" href="http://www.thecollegebook.com">www.thecollegebook.com</a>.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="66" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Reecy-Aresty_4636.jpg" border="0" alt="Reecy Aresty - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>For almost three decades, financial advisor and lecturer Reecy Aresty, has helped thousands of families to protect their assets, increase their wealth, and reduce their taxes.

Student competition is at an all-time high and families now face the toughest admissions committees in history, soaring tuition costs, and a financial aid system designed to eliminate all but the most knowledgeable and persistent applicants.</p><p>America is knee deep in an unsung higher education crisis that is affecting families from all walks of life. Most high school parents are not skilled in college admissions, and the vast majority of those braving the financial aid process without professional help fall victim to a system plagued by complication and confusion. According to the Dept. of Education, the overwhelming majority of those applying for financial aid are initially rejected for errors and inconsistencies!  Adding to the problem is rampant misinformation, even from so-called reliable sources.</p><p>Yet, despite these obstacles, and contrary to what most college-bound families believe, regardless of financial resources, paying for college is not your main concern! Getting accepted to college is the number one priority!  All of the financial aid available is useless without an admission ticket!</p><p>To ensure a student’s college education, planning must begin early - no later than the 9th grade!  This may seem premature, but starting any later could be higher education suicide! The student must be made presentable to the schools, and that cannot be done overnight.  It takes lots of planning, patience, and most importantly, the student must be motivated to succeed.</p><p>Year after year, there are far more qualified applicants than all of our colleges and universities have room for.  In school year 2001-2002, Princeton University received approximately 19,000 applications, but only had enough space for 1,200 freshmen. They rejected 18,000 students! The University of Florida for college year 2002-2003, received approximately 24,000 applications, but only had room for 6,500!  They turned away over 17,000 students!  In both cases, the majority of the rejected students were qualified applicants!</p><p>It is unlawful and would put a shameful stain on our Constitution, if any school were to deny admittance based on color, religion, national origin or race.  In order to legally and morally throw an application in the waste basket, the schools must look elsewhere for any reason to reject an applicant. Thus, the only way to say no to a qualified applicant is to deem the student unacceptable.</p><p>For example, a student with a 3.5 GPA, 1875 SAT I, 28 ACT and 200 community service hours, would be unacceptable to Harvard, but would be qualified at the University of Miami or Ohio State – but not necessarily acceptable to either school. There is a huge difference between being qualified and being acceptable, and knowing the difference makes the difference.</p><p>The days when college admissions was simply a numbers game are long gone.

As a result, schools are forced to reject far more applicants than they accept.   The goal of admissions committees is to weed out the qualified masses and fill their halls with resourceful, well-rounded acceptable students. In today’s highly competitive college admissions process, knowing how to present a student to be acceptable not only substantially increases the chances of being admitted, but is an essential factor for success after college.</p><p>No one knows exactly how every school goes about the acceptance and elimination process, and no two schools follow exactly the same guidelines. However, it’s safe to assume that they go about their arduous task something like this:</p><p>First, the admissions committee assembles around a large conference table.  Everyone is handed a huge pile of folders containing student transcripts, applications, essays, and countless letters of recommendations.  No more than 15 to 20 minutes is likely spent on any one applicant!  They then begin to eliminate unqualified students – those deficient in the numbers.</p><p>Next, they look for professionally prepared applications with thought provoking, interesting, and grammatically flawless essays. They are most impressed with student resumes dating back ten years, detailing academic life, extra curricular activities including community service hours, and a cleverly written special essay, perhaps entitled, “Why I Must Attend The University of…” Admissions committees are ever on the alert for uniquely talented students in the arts, or those having demonstrated exceptional athletic potential. These factors all weigh heavily in the final decision.</p><p>You cannot give birth to an acceptable student, nor can you adopt one, and I’ve never seen one listed in any mail order catalogue I’ve ever read. Acceptable students are made, not born, by families determined to see their children successful in life. To create one; to insure pre-high schoolers have every possible advantage to succeed and go on to their college of choice, the stage must be set early in preparation for the high school years.</p><p>If the student’s home is a circus, and not conducive to studying, it’s time for some major changes. Students must have access to a comfortable place to study with virtually no distractions. A bare minimum of 1½ to 2 hours each night should be devoted to schoolwork, and students should maintain a normal daily routine including a healthy diet and eight hours of sleep.</p><p>Ideally, college-bound students should not be left alone without supervision for long periods of time, certainly no longer than 24 hours!  They should not spend more than 15 hours each week on non-academic activities, and would be ill-advised to regularly burn the midnight oil. The benefits of a good night’s rest cannot be overstated.</p><p>All students should begin by electing to take courses with college in mind.  By the time they enter the 12th grade, they will have created the right posture to make admission committees stand up and take notice.</p><p>Four years of the core subjects are what all colleges are most interested in, unless the student has a special ability as an athlete, vocalist, musician, or artist.  English, Math, a Foreign Language, Science and History make up the core Grade Point Average (GPA) or CGPA. There is also the Honors Point Average (HPA) which includes Honors and Advanced Placement (AP) classes.  Electives such as Art, Physical Education, Music and Computer Programming are of less importance and should only be taken in conjunction with the core subjects.\r Students should take as many Honors and AP classes as possible. The risk/reward ratio comes into play here. Colleges are looking for students who take risks and challenge themselves academically and otherwise. The bonus for earning an ‘A’ or ‘B’ or even a ‘C’ is that it adds extra points to the GPA and gives the student that all-important edge in admissions.</p><p>Receiving an ‘A’ in a non-honors class is not as impressive as earning a ‘B’ in an Honors or AP class.  It demonstrates that the student took a risk and therefore a greater accomplishment is perceived. Admissions officers are as impressed by the challenge taken as they are with the result.</p><p>I’m certainly not suggesting that any student become stressed out by taking classes they are not capable of doing well in, or working beyond reasonable limits. However, for families with an exceptionally bright child, it is highly recommended that they take as many advanced courses as they can comfortably handle. An outstanding academic record has always been and is still the greatest bargaining chip.</p><p>Students should also pursue extracurricular activities such as clubbing, not to be confused with staying out all night partying.  Membership in the Debate Club, Student Council, Key Club and the like is one of the absolute necessities to becoming a well-rounded, acceptable student. Even more beneficial, the student should hold office or take on a leadership role in as many of these clubs as possible. Leadership demonstrates taking a risk and assuming responsibility.</p><p>Even students who are super athletes need some diversity, as sports alone is not enough. Students need to avoid the impression that they are one-dimensional, and do whatever is necessary to portray themselves as multi-faceted.</p><p>Early on, students must also begin to accumulate community service or volunteer hours. However, don’t confuse extracurricular activities with volunteer work. I define extracurricular activities as in-school participation. Community service takes place outside of school, i.e. scouting, working for one’s house of worship, working with AIDS and/or Alzheimer’s patients, seniors, hospice, involvement with the handicapped, and environmental work such as cleaning up beaches or highways.</p><p>By participating in volunteer work with financially, emotionally and/or intellectually challenged people, students demonstrate their compassion and empathy for others, and this will make them shine with admissions officers.  Working with those who are less fortunate also gives the student a much broader idea of how life is outside their own environment.</p><p>Every college-bound student needs an edge in the admissions process whether they apply to  Harvard or their local state college. Competition is fierce, and the painful truth is - no one really cares about any student’s education except the student and their family. It would be ill-advised and unrealistic to expect any favors or kindly ‘ole educators to bend over backwards to ensure the success of any student. Academic achievement is rarely an accident, and creating the acceptable student is the sole responsibility of the student and their family.</p><p>This is one of a series of articles by college admissions and financial aid expert, Reecy Aresty, based on his book, “Getting Into College And Paying For It!”  For further information or to contact him, please visit <a target="_new" href="http://www.thecollegebook.com">www.thecollegebook.com</a>.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="66" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Reecy-Aresty_4636.jpg" border="0" alt="Reecy Aresty - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>For almost three decades, financial advisor & lecturer Reecy Aresty, has helped thousands of families to protect their assets, increase their wealth, and reduce their taxes.

How these and the other admission strategies listed below are used, will determine the course of the student’s college years. Understanding them is an absolute must!</p><p>Early Admission:  Typically, the student applies to college at the beginning of the junior year and simply goes through the process earlier. However, Early Admission is seldom used as it only applies to the most exceptional students who complete all high school requirements prior to the 12th grade, or even earlier. Although it is not binding, I strongly recommend that the student demonstrate a college level of social and emotional maturity before implementing this strategy. Schools often get into a bidding contest to recruit the truly exceptional student, some offering full scholarships for the privilege of having such an accomplished student on their campus!  Nonetheless, use with extreme caution!</p><p>Early Read:  A number of  colleges will offer to calculate a family’s EFC, (the expected family contribution; the minimum amount determined by the federal government that a family will pay at any college for each student). This is done without obligating the student to apply to their school.  Simply send them all your financial information at the beginning of the 12th grade!  Sounds like a good deal, right?  Wrong!  Wherever possible, keep the schools and the federal government out of your wallet!  If the student eventually decides to apply to that school, the aid offer has already been predetermined. Surely, you wouldn’t feel comfortable having the IRS calculate your taxes, so why would you have a college determine your EFC?  Avoid this at all costs!  Failure to heed this advice will result in paying thousands more than you had to for a college education!</p><p>Early Decision:  This is a program with earlier deadlines and notification dates than the regular decision process. Students who apply for an Early Decision program commit to attending that school and only that school. This is a binding contract restricting the student to that one school. Once accepted, the student must notify all other schools applied to and request that their application be withdrawn. There is however, an upside.  If money is not an issue, and the family will not be applying for financial aid, Early Decision is highly recommended, because it will give the student a decisive advantage in the admissions process! On the other hand, if financial aid is an issue, the danger is that the student must attend that college regardless of the financial aid offered!  While Early Decision adds some leverage to being accepted, the financial consequences can be devastating because the student must accept the school’s financial aid package no matter how inadequate it might be! I only recommend Early Decision under very specific circumstances. Also, if you change your mind, rescinding an Early Decision acceptance doesn’t sit well with the schools. This option should only be used with extreme caution.</p><p>Early Decision II:  Offered by some schools, it is virtually identical to Early Decision except the application deadlines are later, usually January 1st.  As with Early Decision, only one school can be applied to. I’m not an advocate of this one either. Follow the Early Decision criteria above and proceed accordingly.</p><p>Early Action:  Except for Early Decision candidates, I encourage all students to apply for Early Action. Students apply from September 15th to January 1st, and notices usually go out between December 15th and January 31st, (dates may vary). Applying for Early Action has one definite advantage. Since the competition is so fierce, the sooner a student applies the better.  For the barely qualified student, this is the only way to go.  It would be highly unlikely such a student would qualify in the general applicant pool, as they would be competing against far too many honor students and would pale by comparison. Also, students apply to college at the beginning of the senior year, and any grades beyond mid-term may not count at all!  Always implement this strategy!\r Early Notification:  This is similar to Early Action, except that some schools might also ask for a commitment to their financial aid package well in advance of the traditional May 1st deadline. Unless they make an offer you can’t refuse, ask them to extend their deadline until the family has had sufficient time to consider all offers from the schools the student has been accepted to. I would strongly advise against negotiations because the student will be at a serious disadvantage with no other offers to compare and accepting could be a very costly mistake!  Avoid this like the plague!</p><p>Open Admissions:  Some four year, most two year and virtually all community colleges will offer all applicants admission on a come-as-you-are basis.  If they have room, as long as you have a high school diploma – you’re in!  Implement when available.</p><p>Rolling Admissions:  (I’ve saved the best for last.) This is a most advantageous school policy for applicants, as colleges offering Rolling Admissions will notify students of their status within a few weeks of receiving all necessary application documents. They usually accept students until such time as their quotas have been satisfied. Check the admissions policies of the schools you’re applying to and by all means implement this strategy whenever and wherever available.</p><p>This is one of a series of articles by college admissions and financial aid expert, Reecy Aresty, based on his book, “Getting Into College And Paying For It!”  For further information or to contact him, please visit <a target="_new" href="http://www.thecollegebook.com">www.thecollegebook.com</a>.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="66" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Reecy-Aresty_4636.jpg" border="0" alt="Reecy Aresty - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>For almost three decades, financial advisor & lecturer Reecy Aresty, has helped thousands of families to protect their assets, increase their wealth, and reduce their taxes.

Nowadays, career colleges can help you obtain a Bachelor’s, Master’s, or even Doctorate Degree in just about any field of study, or they can even help you simply brush up on skills you might already have on your way to earning a certification or Associate’s Degree. So while some career schools might still specialize in vocational trades like auto body repair, masonry or hair styling, the majority of today’s career colleges are designed to help working professionals meet their career objectives.</p><p>Prompted by an inviting and growing selection of career and online colleges, more adults are returning to school than ever before. Whether you’re seeking to advance your current career and education, break into a whole new field, or just enjoy studying something you’ve always wanted to, going back to school can be enjoyable and rewarding.</p><p>And yet, many potential students who could clearly benefit from enrollment at a career college are hesitant to do so. The reason? In too many cases, they are being held back by nothing other than their own fear.</p><p>The First Step is Admitting It</p><p>Let’s begin by getting everything out on the table. Some reservations commonly heard from working adults who are considering a return to college include the concerns that:</p><p>They won’t fit in<br>\r It’s too expensive<br>\r There isn’t enough time in the day<br>\r It will take forever to complete a degree<br>\r Employers won’t view the degree (or certification) as credible<br>\r The coursework won’t be valuable or useful</p><p>In reality, just about any student who has attended a career college—whether online or on-campus—will tell you that there really isn’t anything to fear in a return to school. While they may have once had the same fears as you do now, they learned very quickly that those fears were actually unwarranted.</p><p>By taking each fear one by one, we can begin to understand what these current students now know and how glad they are that they didn’t let their fears hold them back.</p><p>I’m Afraid I Won’t Fit In</p><p>It is common for a person in their thirties or forties to worry that they’ll stick out like a sore thumb in a classroom filled with “kids” from the ages of 18 to 25. However, recent information from the Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Education states that adult students are the fastest growing educational demographic, revealing that 40% of college students are now 25 or older. Further information from the National Center for Education Statistics points out that students age 35 and older rose from 823,00 in 1970 to nearly 3 million by 2001.</p><p>If you’re still worried about fitting in to the classroom as an adult, a few facts that might help allay your concerns include:</p><p>With online learning, you’ll be working on a more individual basis and won’t have to worry about ‘standing out’ in a physical classroom; \r Many colleges, traditional or otherwise, have seen a spike in their ‘older’ students, and it’s likely you won’t be the tiny minority that you expect; and \r Many older adults actually find it rejuvenating and refreshing to be in a classroom environment with a younger group that is eager to learn.</p><p>I’m Afraid It Will Be Too Expensive</p><p>Tuition…books…it all adds up. And many potential students get scared off by the investment it requires to earn their degree. But the key to overcoming this fear is to consider it as just that: an investment in your future. Think long term instead of short term. In almost every case, the career advancement you will get after earning your degree will easily make up for the upfront costs of attending school. Besides, many career colleges—especially those online—may be more affordable than you realize. Do your homework and weigh the long-term benefits before deciding not to enroll in a school for this reason.</p><p>I’m Afraid It Will Take Up Too Much Time</p><p>For the busy working adult, the notion of taking on any additional endeavors can be downright stifling. It’s not always easy balancing work with personal life, and adding school on top of all your other responsibilities might seem virtually impossible.</p><p>And yet, it’s not. You’d be amazed at how much extra time you can squeeze into a day. Sure, there will be some sacrifices you’ll have to make, but if you just try watching a little less television, say, or letting your friends know that you won’t be able to make that barbecue next weekend, you’ll be amazed at how much time you can free up. Just remember to keep your eye on the prize, and your sacrifices will all seem worthwhile.</p><p>One good option for students who might have a hard time committing to a schedule is to enroll in online courses that are “asynchronous.” The asynchronous learning model works a bit like email in that you can access the coursework, instructor’s lessons and classmates comments at your convenience, then respond whenever you are able. There are no set classes for you to attend, no specific schedules that might conflict with the rest of your day, and, because you’ll be taking classes online, no commute time for you to worry about.</p><p>I’m Afraid It Will Take Forever To Complete My Degree</p><p>Traditionally, a Bachelor’s Degree takes up to four years to complete, a Master’s Degree requires at least two years, and a Doctorate Degree can take up to eight years or more. That’s all fine and good for someone who can dedicate themselves to being a full time student, but for those who can only commit to part-time status, those timelines might appear too far off the horizon.</p><p>But the facts of the matter are that most degree programs at today’s career colleges are based on accelerated learning, meaning that most degrees take less time to complete than traditional learning environments. Coursework is based on shorter semesters—typically five weeks—and delivering a quality education as rapidly as possible without sacrificing the student’s ability to learn and absorb the material. In some cases you can even earn your degree is less than a year!</p><p>I’m Afraid That Employers Won’t Take My Degree Seriously</p><p>Because their degree won’t be coming from some top-name university like Harvard or Yale, some would-be students decide that it’s not worth getting a degree from a school that employer’s won’t view as credible.</p><p>In reality, however, most employers today do view degrees from career colleges as not only credible, but oftentimes on par with their more traditional counterparts. It wasn’t that long ago that many HR professional may have viewed career colleges—particularly online career colleges—as carrying less weight than traditional colleges, but as the online education space evolves and faculty members and curriculums at online schools catches up with those at traditional schools, more and more HR executives are realizing the validity of degrees earned online or through career colleges. In fact, to some, an online degree represents a certain career ambition, technological prowess and commitment to seeing something through to the end on behalf of the applicant.</p><p>I’m Afraid I Won’t Learn Anything New Or Valuable</p><p>Many potential students are fearful of the fact that their trouble to go out and earn their degree might be all for naught—that the classes won’t teach them anything they hadn’t learned already in their professional experiences.</p><p>As anyone who has ever taken so much as a single class at a career college or online school will tell you, however, this perception couldn’t be further from the truth. Classes at any accredited university are taught by qualified experts with lots of experience in their chosen field, while you will also be surrounded by classmates who bring their own, unique experiences to share. Whether the “classroom” is physical or virtual, you will learn more than you ever imagined from those around you.</p><p>Another point to consider is that most career colleges are centered around a team learning approach, in which students learn not only from their instructors, but from other students as well. With this approach, you’ll engage in dialogues with other students who have much to share from their own work experiences, and you’ll gain valuable lessons that you can take back and immediately apply to your own work.</p><p>Why Make The Move?</p><p>In today’s modern learning environment, with numerous career and online schools focused entirely on their educational needs, adults have nothing to fear in a return to school – and so much to gain. Here are some of the main reasons more adults than ever are going back to school:</p><p>Career advancement or transition. If you’re not currently working at the job of your dreams, nothing can change that faster than a more advanced degree and additional expertise.</p><p>To complete a degree from years ago. Plenty of first-time college students leave before they earn a degree, and a return to college is a supremely satisfying way to take care of that unfinished business.</p><p>To set an example for their children. What better way to encourage your growing children to pursue a college education than getting one of your own?</p><p>To fully prepare for running their own business. Whether you’re interested in opening a B&B or your own accounting firm, the perfect college program is available online or on-campus.</p><p>Returning to school is a big step, but it shouldn’t be an overwhelming one. For those who plan the move properly and take aim on getting all they can out of life, it can be the best decision they ever make.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Matt McAllister is a writer for <a target="_new" href="http://www.searchforclasses.com">http://www.searchforclasses.com</a>.

Keep in mind that you will work harder to finish faster and must be willing to make this commitment.</p><p>Check with an admissions counselor to see if you qualify for the Credit for Life Experience Program (CLEP).  Experience in the business world can translate into college credits with this program.  You will have to show documentation of your work experience. The school will verify this experience to determine how it fits into your degree program in terms of college credit.  The credits you receive from this program can shorten the time you spend earning your degree. This program isn’t offered at all schools or for all degree programs.</p><p>The Proficiency Exam Program (PEP) is similar to CLEP.  This program allows students to earn college credit for independent study or other training received without college credit.  You may have learned the subject matter in another forum and not need to take the class. You will have to show documentation and pass an exam to qualify for credits with PEP.</p><p>Many online universities offer shorter semesters.  Some will give you the choice between six, eight and ten week semesters. Shorter semesters allow you to take more classes throughout the year.  Keep in mind that these shorter semesters still carry the same requirements. The work load will be more intense, but the time period will be shorter. Be sure you have the time to devote before you choose shorter semesters.  The pace is faster and you will need to work faster to keep up.</p><p>You can take more classes each semester.  Even taking one additional class each semester can take a year off the time you will spend in school.  You will have to make time for an additional class each semester, but you''ll finish faster.  When you plan your classes, schedule a mixture of subjects you find easy with more difficult courses.  This way, you won''t end up with all the subjects you find difficult at the end of your program.</p><p>Some online universities don''t require students take general education classes.  Your program will focus entirely on your field of study.  Often, this structure results in a shorter time spent earning the degree.  If you plan to transfer your credits to another university, check before enrolling in the program to make sure the credits are transferable.</p><p>Saturday Scholars Programs are offered at many large universities. Students entering this program should hold an Associates degree before applying to the program.  You travel to the university on Saturdays, usually from eight in the morning until five in the evening.  These programs allow you to finish your degree in two years of Saturdays.</p><p>Self paced programs are offered through some online colleges.  These classes can be started at any time and finished at your own pace.  You can work through the material more quickly than is possible in the typical college semester.  Quite a few of these programs set a minimum time you must take the course.  Usually they require a six week minimum time frame for completion.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Katie Robbins a freelance writer for degreeclick.com, a web resource where she regularly publishes informative articles about online education.

These are often available in public libraries or community centers. You may feel overwhelmed at the thought of taking another class, but the time you spend learning to use the technology will save you time in the long run.</p><p>Most colleges offer support for new students.  Some schools may have orientation sessions at the start of a new semester.  If your school offers this, plan on attending.  You will gain valuable information about the structure of the course and the technology used.  Instructors often give advice for organizing your time at these sessions.  In addition, you will get a feel for the teacher''s expectations.  Most schools offer tutorials to help you learn to use the online classroom and other software used in distance learning programs.</p><p>Research papers are common assignments in both traditional and distance learning college courses.

Quite a bit of research can be done online, which can save you time as well.</p><p>The workload in distance learning courses is similar to traditional college coursework.  The basic format of most courses involves studying the text, completing assignments and taking exams.  Just about all work will involve reading and writing, so take some time to improve your skills in these areas. You will most likely have a fair amount of reading assigned both in the text and from outside sources.  Schedule enough time to complete all reading assignments.  Get the textbooks early and read the first few chapters before classes start to become familiar with the material.</p><p>Taking non traditional college courses requires commitment and time management skills.  The ability to work at your own pace can turn into procrastination.  Set goals for yourself and make a schedule that will allow you to reach those goals in a reasonable amount of time.

List your long and short term career goals to help you decide which degree will help you reach your goals best.  Once you have decided on a major, you can start to research different schools.</p><p>Find out the requirements for admission into the program.  Each university has its own set of regulations.  All schools will want to see your transcripts from high school or college.  Some will ask for test scores as well.  Make sure you can meet the minimum requirements for admission before you apply.  Gathering the necessary documentation before beginning the application process will save time later.</p><p>Distance education programs have different on campus requirements. Some require that you come to campus a few times each semester, while others allow you to complete the entire program at home.  Programs offered completely online are more difficult to find, depending on the degree you are seeking.  Make sure you can commit to the schedule required by the university. A program that requires you to travel to campus one or more times should be within driving distance of your home.</p><p>Find out if the school you will be attending is regionally accredited.  Accreditation only matters when you need financial aid or plan to transfer the credits you receive to another university.  Some accept credits from schools that are regionally accredited, but others do not.  Check with the college you plan on attending later to make sure the credits will transfer.  If you are getting your complete degree from the same school, accreditation may not be important.</p><p>Another time accreditation may matter is if you are completing a degree that will require a state license.  Degrees in nursing, social work and education require licensing.  Check with your state to make sure they will accept your degree for licensing.  Some states won''t accept degrees from schools not recognized by the US Department of Education.  Check with your school, state or Department of education to find out if the college is recognized.</p><p>If you have credits you want to transfer from another school, make sure the online university you are considering will accept your credits.  Have your official transcripts sent to the school for an admissions counselor to review.  Ask about any restrictions the school has for transferring credits.  Most colleges won''t accept more than fifty percent of the degree requirements in transfer credits.  Some have a limit on the time you can transfer credits, usually ten years.</p><p>Ask if the university offers credit for job or life experience.  If you have extensive experience in the business world, some schools will give you some college credits for this. You may be required to show documentation of your experience or be given an exam. The requirements and number of credits offered varies by school, so be sure to ask.  These credits can shorten the amount of time you need to spend in school and can help get your degree faster.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Katie Robbins is the owner of degreeclick.com, a web resource where she regularly publishes informative articles about online education.

Voting responsibly and participating in democracy the way we should is dependant on understanding economics.”</p><p>Dr. Douglas entered the world of economics after teaching at the high school level and taking a few years to see the world.  Since joining the College of B&E, Douglas has brought his life experience together with his joy of teaching to make economics accessible to everyone.</p><p>“Many students don’t know why they need to know economics,” Douglas said.  “Most people can get through life without it, but it’s a point of view and a way of thinking that is helpful for a lot of people.”</p><p>In the 15 years Douglas has spent at WVU, he has won the B&E Outstanding Teacher Award three times, most recently in 2000.  He has also been honored as Outstanding Researcher by the College of B&E twice.</p><p>"Somebody 19 or 20 needs to be motivated initially, but they show me how to teach once they are engaged," Douglas said.

Classes filled with lots of theory can be intimidating for students who are used to answers being “black” and “white,” but Dr. Bone’s approach to teaching lets students know what is right despite a lot of gray area.</p><p>“When I teach a class, I am also learning from my students,” said Bone.  “New ideas are always around, and seeing things through different sets of eyes keeps my material from having hard, fast answers.”</p><p>Bone is one of the most decorated and honored professors in the College of B&E.  In her 18 years of teaching she has received two Golden Apple teaching awards, given annually by WVU students.  She has also been named Outstanding Teacher and Outstanding Researcher from the College of B&E.  In 2004, Bone won Outstanding Teacher from the WVU Foundation.  This is one of the highest honors for a WVU professor, as only six are recognized each year.</p><p>“A person in today’s society needs to be able to find solutions,” said Bone.  “I teach people to think.

It’s how that information is pulled together to come up with a unique solution that needs to be taught.”</p><p>The experience and expertise Bone brings to her classes goes beyond notes on a projector.  In September 2004, she presented findings on consumer use and interpretation of dietary supplement labels with Karen France to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  She is also administering a project with WVU marketing students which monitors the economic development associated with the Hatfield/McCoy ATV trail.</p><p>“My classes give students many opportunities,” said Bone. “Teachers need to create a situation that allows students to shine.

She also serves on the board of Marketing and Society Special Interest Group and is on the editorial review board of the Journal of Public Policy and Marketing.  These accomplishments have made her an open-book reference for students as the role marketing plays in the business equation continues to increase.</p><p>“Teachers need to be a resource for their students.

Last year, television host Terry Wogan condemned the competition as “biased” and called on the Broadcasting Union to take action.

However, the student continued to study in Oxford for several weeks after his conviction and did not inform his college or the University.</p><p>The student, whom The Oxford Student has decided not to name, was convicted on 5th May on eight counts of possessing child pornography and sentenced to a three year Community Rehabilitation Order as well as being placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register. Neither Oxford University nor the student’s college were aware of the conviction before being contacted by The Oxford Student.</p><p>A Senior Member of the college’s staff told this newspaper: “We were not aware of this and we have to respect whatever process he was put through.” A spokeswoman for the University admitted it could not necessarily prevent convicted students from returning to Oxford: “The way the criminal justice system works means that there is no obligation for a student to inform the University of any conviction.</p><p>“We do co-operate closely with local police but if a student is convicted outside of Oxford there is little the University can do.” When this newspaper spoke to the student, he confirmed he had been convicted and given the rehabilitation order. He added he had first been arrested 13 months before the hearing.</p><p>However he maintained: “The sentence was excessive, I am considering appealing” Before The Oxford Student spoke to him, he had not been contacted by the University or his college over the matter. The student had been charged under the Criminal Justice Act 1988, Chapter 33 Section 160: Possession of an indecent photograph of a child.</p><p>At the hearing, where the student pleaded guilty, his lawyer, Mr Smith [name has been changed], said that his client had been downloading images from websites like ‘Gay Teen’ for three or four years but stressed that he had not been seeking child pornography and would often have been looking at males who were only two years younger than himself. However the presiding District Judge rejected claims that the defendant had stumbled across the images by accident.</p><p>He said: “Those files are there because he selected them and there’s what looks like an eight-year-old boy among them. “There’s no doubt into what waters your client was fishing, Mr Smith.” The Oxford Student understands that at a preliminary hearing, the student did not enter a plea. Sentencing the student, the Judge said: “These photos are not large in number. Some are grotesque, all are revolting, and now, at the 11th hour, you have admitted that you sought them out and downloaded them.” The student was told by the Judge: “If you re-offend during this period [the three year Community Rehabilitation Order] with a matter of this kind you will be going to jail.” The order placed on the student allows for his case to be transferred between Oxford Probation Services and his local Probation Services as he moves between Oxford and his home.</p><p>Smith confirmed that his client’s Community Rehabilitation Order had been transferred to Oxford Probation Services whilst his client was in the city. For the initial period of the order, he has to report to a supervisor every week although it is subject to review after three months. The University Proctors’ Office could not confirm or deny that they were dealing with the case, but Statute XI of the university regulations states: ‘43. (1) If a student member has been convicted of a criminal offence of such seriousness that an immediate term of imprisonment might have been imposed (and whether or not such a sentence was in fact imposed on the student member) the Proctors shall refer the matter to the Disciplinary Court which may ... expel the student member from his or her membership of the University or impose such lesser penalty as it thinks fit.’ The offences of which the student was convicted are of such seriousness.</p><p>The student told this newspaper he intends to stay in Oxford and complete his degree, however a senior source within the University have told The Oxford Student it is likely he will be sent down. The University would not comment specifically on the case, but a spokeswoman said: “If a student was perceived to be a danger to other students, it would be something the University Marshall would have to take a decision on.”</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Gianfranco Fracassi is the webmaster of two popular free stuff web sites. \r You can find many subjects that will interest  you.

Working is looked upon favorably by the \r\nmore selective colleges; working on your tan is not...', '<p>At last, summer is here!  After a school year full of hard work, you can \r finally put away your books, break out your bikinis, and soak up the \r sunshine.  This is not only what you deserve but in fact what you need: If \r you have been working to your maximum level during the school year, \r you owe your body about two weeks off during the summer for a real \r break.  Go ahead and pursue your favorite pastime, relax, sleep, and \r reflect on the past year and the year to come.  Do not, however, get too \r used to your life of leisure!  From a college admissions standpoint, it’s \r important to be productive during your summer months.  Working is \r looked upon favorably by the more selective colleges; working on your \r tan is not.</p><p>It is important to understand that when it comes time to apply to schools \r in the fall, you will be competing for admission against a wealth of other \r students who made the most of their summers by strengthening their \r talents and skills and/or making up in some way for their weaknesses.  \r Ideally, you have already found something to do for the summer, but if \r not, here are some summer suggestions.</p><p>For the summer after ninth grade, summer school can be a great idea, \r particularly if you want to get ahead in your curriculum.  For example, \r rising sophomores in the past have used their summers to skip ahead in \r their math track, some by taking a class that prepares them for an \r honors or advanced level course, others by taking an intensive math \r course that spans at least six weeks of the summer.  Other students \r have chosen to use their summers to take composition or creative \r writing courses to strengthen their writing skills.</p><p>For the summer after tenth grade, you might want to try participating in a \r program designed to strengthen one of your main talents.  For example, \r if you’re interested in engineering, you could try a program that teaches \r students to design their own autonomous robots, such as Carnegie \r Mellon West’s seven-week RoboCamp.  Students who are artistically \r inclined may want to try Northwestern’s National High School Institutes \r (colloquially known as “Cherubs”), during which students who excel in \r music, theater, journalism, film, debate and/or forensics hone their \r talents through intensive workshops in their areas of interest.  Another \r great opportunity for prospective film students is through University of \r Southern California’s Summer Seminars, where students can study \r either screenwriting, the business and technology of film, or basic \r animation techniques.</p><p>The summer after tenth grade also might be used to go away on a \r program abroad.  Two great resources for finding abroad programs are \r www.goabroad.com and www.studyabroad.com, where you can punch \r in specific countries and interests and find hundreds of excellent \r programs that are off the beaten track.  I recommend committing to a \r program of at least six weeks: A true cultural immersion will usually take \r more than a month, and it will take two weeks just to get over your jet \r lag!  Also, try to travel to a country where the residents speak the foreign \r language you’re taking in school.  In order to make the most of your \r experience, try and stay away from programs with too many other \r Americans, and try to devote yourself to one place for the entire stay.  \r For example, if you’re taking Spanish in school, it’s best to go to Mexico \r or a Central or Latin American country rather than Spain, which is often \r teeming with Americans.  Also, in cities such as Barcelona, the \r language of choice is Catalan as opposed to Spanish.</p><p>The summer after eleventh grade is a good time to try and find an \r internship or other type of employment experience in one of your fields \r of interest.  If you’re interested in a sports-related career, let’s say, this is \r an excellent summer to work for a sports agency or a sports channel \r such as ESPN.  To see the sports world from a different angle, you might \r even want to try working in a law firm that has a history of representing \r athletes.  Not only would you gain valuable experience that would give \r you a leg up on even the average college student, you might find a new \r translation of your passion for sports.</p><p>Remember, nepotism is not looked upon favorably, so make sure your \r work experience is aligned with your interests and not with your parents’ \r careers.  After all, you are not just spending the summer in Dad’s office; \r this should be made clear to the colleges.  Likewise, if you’re holding \r down a job or internship, the ideal amount of time to do this is for about \r eight weeks.  Given that the typical summer is twelve weeks long, you’ll \r still have several weeks for relaxation and, of course, working on \r college applications.  IvyWise students in the past have interned in the \r office of Senator Hillary Clinton, conducted original cancer research at \r hospitals alongside professors, reported for major and local \r newspapers, and interned at a variety of companies ranging from law \r firms to Goldman Sachs.</p><p>If you’re a serious athlete with the chance of being recruited for your \r sport in college, you will likely be spending the majority of your summers \r on the field or in the gym, where coaches will get a chance to watch you \r play.  Sports camps and workshops are great for serious student \r athletes; this is the path you must pursue to achieve entry into college-\r level athletics.</p><p>Before you leave for summer break, I also recommend asking your \r school for next year’s reading list for English and history.  Beginning \r your reading early is a great way to get a jump start on next year’s \r homework.  Also, starting your reading list during the summer will help \r you gain a deeper understanding of the assigned material: When you \r revisit your summer reading during the school year, you will be familiar \r with the basic story and will therefore be equipped to conduct a better \r analysis of the text.  Also, if you choose to remain in your hometown \r during the summer, colleges will love to see you continuing your school \r year community service activities through the summer months.</p><p>Summer don’ts:</p><p>#1: CAMP.  Unless you are a focused athlete and you are attending a \r sports camp, sleepaway camp and camping trips should end before the \r summer before ninth grade.  The only exception to this rule is if a \r student has the opportunity to take on a leadership role such as a CIT, \r and even then, the summer before ninth grade should be the last year at \r camp.  Colleges are not looking for experts in the arts of s’more-making \r and Spin the Bottle!</p><p>#2: TEEN TOURS.  It may sound great to travel around the country with \r a busload of other kids in your age group for a couple of weeks, and \r while it’s true that you would get to sample the cuisine of many different \r McDonald’s locations across the country, this will not help you get into \r college.  On a teen tour, students can never get to know one place well, \r and it’s likely that they will be with students like themselves and will \r therefore not get the opportunity to stretch.  Teen tours are so organized \r and scheduled that it’s nearly impossible for any one student to make an \r impact in his or her community.  Students should make sure that \r whatever they do over the summer, they are somehow making an \r impact, whether it be on an organization, a favorite cause, or a foreign or \r local community.</p><p>#3: “IMMERSION” TRIPS.  Any so-called cultural immersion trip that \r lasts three weeks or less, particularly those of the Putney or ASA brand, \r is not a wise use of summer time.  These trips break up a student’s \r summer and take the place of an in-depth program; they are vacations \r rather than commitments and are not something to add to a college brag \r sheet.  Again, students should choose a program off the beaten track \r that lasts for a minimum of six weeks so they have the opportunity to \r grow and to make an impact.</p><p>#4: SUMMER SAT PREP.  If you’re a rising junior, the summer is not the \r best time to start preparing for your standardized tests.  Sure, working on \r vocabulary a few hours a week can never hurt, but devoting chunks of \r your day to SAT tutoring or a class will only take the place of an activity \r that you can put on your brag sheet.  Furthermore, you are likely to \r forget a lot of what you learn during the summer; you will absorb far \r more during the year, when you are in “school mode.”</p><p>On a final note, when you are setting aside your personal time, make \r sure you allow yourself time to have fun!  As high school progresses, the \r courses inevitably get harder and your workload will increases—it’s \r important to use your summer break to unwind and reflect.  While there \r are always weekends during the school year, there’s nothing like a \r sunny Wednesday on the beach, so please, make the most of your \r freedom while you can!  Have a great summer, and we’re looking \r forward to hearing your stories.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Katherine Cohen is a college counselor at IvyWise, LLC, \r <a target="_new" href="http://www.ivywise.com">http://www.ivywise.com</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

Check with the university for application deadlines.  Just about all schools charge an application fee; these fees are usually small.</p><p>You will need to include any supporting documentation required by the school where you are applying. You will find this information included with the application.  All schools require original transcripts from all schools previously attended. This will include both high school and college transcripts.  A few schools look for college preparatory courses in high school.  Send your requests early to allow enough time for transcripts to arrive at the college.  Some schools will require SAT test scores and immunization records as well.</p><p>You will have to meet the admission requirements of the college you will be attending.  The requirements vary by school and in some cases can be different based on your major. Be sure to check with the university to determine the requirements.  Many schools have a minimum SAT score requirement for admission, although some waive this for some programs or for non traditional students.  Non traditional students are defined as older students who have been out of high school for at least five years and have work experience. Students transferring from other institutions are in this category as well.</p><p>Many schools require students pass placement tests prior to registering for classes.  These tests usually have English, math and writing components.  This is to determine if potential students have the reading, writing and math skills necessary to succeed in college. If you don''t pass one of the placement tests, you may be required to take remedial courses prior to starting your degree; this is not unusual for people returning to school after many years.  Graduate programs will usually require additional testing, such as the Graduate Record Exam (GRE).</p><p>When you apply to the school, you can also apply for financial aid.  Talk to a representative about programs available to students in the form of financial aid and scholarships.  Start the process by filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).  Complete the application even if you don’t think you will qualify for federal aid.  Most other student loan programs use the same application. To be able to accept federal financial aid, the school must be regionally accredited.  Accreditation is a voluntary process and matters mainly for financial aid and transferring credit to other universities.  Check with an admissions counselor if you''re not sure about accreditation.</p><p>Once you have completed all applications and testing, you will find out if you have been accepted into the program.  Once you have been accepted, you will be eligible to register for classes and begin the journey toward your college degree.  The admissions counselor at your university can assist you in scheduling your courses.  There is often an order in which classes should be taken.  Once you have registered, you pay for your classes, get your books and attend orientation, if required.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Katie Robbins is a professional writer, providing content to help the online student.

This expected contribution effects the amount available to the student for grants.</p><p>Another significant factor is that if the parent or guardian claims the student as a dependent on income tax returns, this effects the amount of aid available to the student.

Instead, UWI is churning out bookworms that lack entrepreneurial vision!', '<p>The University of the West Indies (UWI) has often been viewed as a long-standing partner to Caribbean Governments in fostering integration and development of our people, and forming strategic alliances.</p><p>CARICOM member states are now considering the establishment of a single market economy. This will mean the general removal of all legal and administrative restrictions to trade.  Increased competition among these states is therefore inevitable. The ability of member states to survive the effects of trade liberalisation will among other things depend on the capacity of its human resources and its learning institutions. The role that UWI is playing in enabling the people and countries of the region to make the transition will therefore come under great scrutiny.  Many, including graduates of the University, believe that “UWI simply isn’t doing enough!”</p><p>UWI’s role has been assessed based on changes in its curriculum, the level of intellectual discussion stimulated on the topic among people of the region and the extent to which it has facilitated product development by enhancing the regions access to specialised training and technology transfer.</p><p>A major criticism levelled against the University is that it has failed to employ innovative strategies and radical curriculum engineering in achieving the transformation required to strategically address the challenges facing the region.</p><p>To the question of whether the University has enhanced the intellectual capacity of the people of the region, the answer is an emphatic yes. But when asked whether its efforts have equalled those of reputable universities around the world, the response is not equally convincing.</p><p>Caribbean entrepreneurs argue that UWI has not instilled in its graduates, the dramatic changes in attitude and perspectives required to assist the business sector in confronting the challenges of the CSME.  Amidst a climate of high unemployment among graduates, the view is that UWI is not equipping its graduates to seek opportunities for self-employment.  Instead, UWI is churning out bookworms that lack entrepreneurial vision!</p><p>The question has also been asked about whether the University has increased opportunities for regional cooperation in human, economic and social development.  No doubt, it has played a critical and significant role in integrating the people and countries of the region.  In fact, it can be argued that UWI has played a pivotal role in advancing the spirit of cooperation and integration that has made the Caribbean single market a reality.  In comparison to the “much-lauded” CARICOM Federation, the continuing achievements of the University of the West Indies dispel the arguments that the region cannot unite.</p><p>But is UWI doing enough to assist graduates to confront the changes in the international trading environment and the implications for small, open economies like ours? There is only so much that institutions of the region, such as UWI can do. The business sector armed with a more educated workforce must now do the rest.</p><p>One thing is certain. UWI has over the years engendered a spirit of regional cooperation and Caribbean identity.  Without a doubt, the University, as a regional institution, has served as a beacon in bringing the people and countries of the region together.  To suggest otherwise is to be overly critical and to underscore the efforts of the Governments, University Officials and Graduates who have contributed to this process.  But amidst these efforts, University Officials admit that the numbers of OECS (Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States) registrants continue to decline.  More and more students of the region are looking towards programmes at foreign universities, albeit self funded and more expensive. Why is that? The answer may lie in the fact that the university has itself failed to adapt to the changing climate.</p><p>The present economic climate requires the region’s tertiary learning institutions to swiftly provide a broad base of skilled professionals. This, it is believed, will set in motion the potential for the region to compete with the mega trade blocs that have emerged, in recent time. This requires that our learning institutions facilitate more wide spread and affordable access to education for the people of the region.  The Developed Countries have resorted to online distant learning programmes to achieve this objective. Admittedly, one of the compelling shortcomings of UWI is that while major universities around the world have successfully established reputable online learning programmes, “UWI is still trying to play catch up.”  The absence of an effective online learning programme that facilitates widespread and cost effective access to tertiary education, says it all.  In the context of our geography, it is indicative of the University’s inability to adequately position itself to meet the needs of the people and countries of the region.</p><p>Who is to say that UWI’s strategies and timing are not in keeping with the demonstrated needs of its people? The real question is what role should UWI play in preparing the region for CSME.  Is there a defined role or a specific aspect for which it should assume responsibility? The issue of whether UWI is doing enough or what it should be doing will remain a topic for debate. What is beyond dispute is that UWI can and should be doing more to prepare the region for the challenges of the CSME.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Eldonna Lendor is a Business Strategist, Trade Consultant and Corporate Attorney.

If you are having problems securing 15 hours, ask the following question: Since I am earning a 4-year degree, how can I do that only taking 12 hours per semester?

This plan will change due to course changes, degree changes, etc.  However, this 4-year plan provides you with the “BIG” picture and then allows you to begin to take small bites.</p><p>Tip #5 – Plan Your Weekly Schedule.</p><p>Plan your weekly schedule including study time, research time, etc. For each 3-hour course, expect to spend 2 to 4 hours per week. Some courses such as English Literature may require substantial reading. If you are a slower reader allow for more reading time. If you are only going to school for 15 hours per week, there is plenty of time to study before, in between and after your classes. Many baby boomer graduates worked full time jobs while taking 15 to 18 hours.</p><p>Tip #6 – Focus on Your Graduation Goal Date.</p><p>Every additional semester that you spend in college is costing you a minimum of $20,000 - $5,000 tuition and $15,000 in loss earnings. All of your actions should be directed to achieving your graduate goal date.</p><p>Tip #7 – Make Wise Choices.</p><p>You, and only you, are responsible for the choices that you make. For parents, set the expectation that you expect your daughter or son to graduate in 4 years. Students accept that expectation and run with it. If you are having trouble with time management, goal planning and achievement, studying skills, course content, decision making or problem solving, make a wise choice and find some solutions.</p><p>Remember, by graduating in 4 years, you have an edge over those students who chose to play the “Low Expectation Game” and you can start the life that you dreamed only 4 years earlier.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="72" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Leanne-Hoagland-Smith_5045.jpg" border="0" alt="Leanne Hoagland-Smith - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>Leanne Hoagland-Smith, M.S.

Earning a 4 year degree in the U.S. now takes 5.3 years.  Read how this very expensive and damaging trend affects you, your children and our society.', '<p>During a recent conversation with a client, he shared with me his frustration when registering his son for his first year at college.  This university, incidentally one of the big 10, would only allow his son to register for 12 hours. The university’s position was the "expectation" that 12 hours was very, very difficult and for him to expect more as a parent was not realistic.</p><p>I suggested for my client to have a new conversation with the university and simply ask the following question: Since my son is earning a 4-year degree, how can he do that only taking 12 hours per semester?  With most 4-year degrees averaging 120 hours, taking 12 hours per semester requires 5 years (12x2x5).  Given that some required courses are only offered once a year and may have additional criteria, 5 years can easily stretch into 5.5 or 6 years.  This expectation game of taking only 12 hours per semester may be one of the answers as to why the U.S. national average is 5.3 years to earn a four-year degree.</p><p>Many parents are planning for their children to attend a post-secondary experience at a local junior college, a public or private university.  In 2003-04 academic year, the average tuition investment for one year in a four-year public college or university was $4,694.  This represented a 14% increased over the previous year. Room and board costs could increase that investment by $10,636 to a total of $15,330.  With books, supplies and additional fees, this total could increase by another $1,000 to $3,000. Given that college costs continue to rise much greater than the cost of inflation, each additional year becomes more expensive that the previous one.</p><p>Not only are colleges costing student and parents directly with the additional one to two years, they are also affecting the future of these young people.  If the students agree with the university’s expectation game and stay in college another year or two, they are losing earning dollars and two potential years of gainful experience. This loss affects their ability to move up the corporate ladder.</p><p>Parents suffer because college is expensive even when planned and parents have other needs to direct those college dollars.  By not being proactive and insisting on at least 15 hours per semester, the parent’s financial future is jeopardized.</p><p>Taxpayers are also losing in this game of low expectations because young people who aren’t in the workforce full time are not contributing to significantly to the local, state and federal taxes especially social security. Communities suffer because loss of income contributes to negative economic development.</p><p>The only winners in this game of "Low Expectations" are the public universities and their professors who incidentally are paid with taxpayers’ dollars.  Given that the U.S. is graduating the same percentage of college graduates as in the early 50’s, this game of "Low Expectations" demonstrates when you set the bar low, you get what you expect - poor performance.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="72" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Leanne-Hoagland-Smith_5045.jpg" border="0" alt="Leanne Hoagland-Smith - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>Leanne Hoagland-Smith, M.S.

These programs were expanded to include higher education and, with the advent of the internet, students can now work with their instructors via email, videophone, or web conferencing.</p><p>Why should you choose to earn your degree online?

Unlike traditional degree programs, students are not required to physically attend classes, which means that they can work around their job or family schedules.  If you are working full-time but want to further your career or even change professions, online education is right for you.  While some universities offering online degrees have a set class schedule, many do not.  You can simply log-on to the course website and either listen to audio and video lectures, or participate in a live discussion via chat.

While there a many good, recognized diploma or degree programs available through online education, choosing the one which is right for you can seem like a daunting task.</p><p>There are many factors which you should take into consideration, when choosing your online college. For example, you''ll need to consider which technologies are used in the program.  Does the institution use print, audio, or video delivery media?  How will you interact between the instructor and the rest of the class? Will it be via asynchronous means, such as email, listservs, or newsgroups, via synchronous delivery methods, like streaming online audio and video, or shared whiteboards?  The technological delivery of the course content will be key to your decision, as it will determine the amount and frequency of your interaction with the instructor and other students.</p><p>You should also be diligent about researching the college''s accreditation and its reputation.  In order to be certain that you are getting the best education possible, you must be certain that the institution has some sort of official recognition. Accreditation is the process through which a college''s educational programs are evaluated to ensure that certain standards are upheld.  This process is usually done by a form of peer review, and the standards tend to vary from awarding body to awarding body.  Being aware of the university''s accreditation is usually a good indicator of what sort of value that you are getting for your tuition.</p><p>Likewise, it is very important to check out your instructor''s credentials and experience in the field, as well.  Your experience of the course will depend upon his or her knowledge and delivery style, so make sure that you know with whom you will be working.</p><p>Finally, you may want to consider speaking with one of the college''s former students,  as this will give you an insider''s look into the program and the university.  Alumnae are often honest about their experiences- whether good or bad- and they can give you a better idea of what to expect from the course.</p><p>Pursuing a degree online can be a rewarding and memorable experience, especially if you do your homework before logging-in to the course.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Matt Norman is the founder of <a target="_new" href="http://www.easy-online-degrees.com"> Easy Distance Learning </a> a website providing information on learning online</p><!--UdmComment-->');

But here is the problem: People like storytellers. They hate liars.  The meaning is similar but different. In the South, storytellers sit on porch swings and drink ice tea. Liars stare down the barrel of shotguns.</p><p>I should know. I’m from the South and we shoot liars all the time. Of course, I’m lying. But I can’t help it. After all, I am a “Southern” storyteller.  I emphasis the adjective because I believe Southerners tell stories for reasons that are not always apparent to our friends in other parts of the United States. Our stories are more than entertainment. They teach lessons and those lessons are always filled with wisdom that is inspirational.</p><p>For example, everybody knows the old saying “you can’t teach an old dog new tricks.”  I bet what people don’t know is that it comes from the South.  Of course, people in the Midwest will swear it’s theirs. They’re lying.  If they just happen to be telling the truth, then it doesn’t really matter because I’ll still say it’s ours. In fact, we have been using that saying for so long that strong personal philosophies have grown up around it.  One man says, “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks, but you can teach old tricks to a new dog.”  Then the man sitting next to him will say, “What dogs won’t learn, cats will.”  These two men could sit on the porch and twist and turn one simple idea a million different ways—and I’m not lying.</p><p>This story illustrates a more complex idea that I want to make about the relationship between storytelling and students.  In his book “All Marketers are Liars,” Seth Godin claims that marketing is about telling a good story. Successful marketers tell us stories that match our belief systems and these stories directly influence our behavior.  I understand Godin’s points. What I fail to understand is why students don’t appropriate this behavior when it comes to marketing themselves to themselves.  It seems to me to be the most important skill students can develop and exploit. But they don’t.  Students are malcontent and maladjusted because storytelling has been outsourced to actors, singers, reporters, politicians, and marketers who are not always heavily invested in telling them the truth. These people influence the stories students tell themselves. This influence is why students have stopped telling themselves stories to celebrate their differences. It is more acceptable to be like others. Students have stopped telling themselves stories for inspiration. Religious leaders and talk show hosts fill this gap. Storytelling is in the hands of the folks in New York and Hollywood and they are not giving it back without a fight.</p><p>My advice to students is simple. Prepare to fight. Southerners are always up for a brawl. After all, we did lose the war.  But we learned some lessons that no other region in the United States has ever had to learn. We learned to love ourselves.  We learned that storytelling is transformative.  It uplifts. It heals.  And if we lack influence, wealth, beauty, and fame (qualities all students covet), we always own a more powerful tool. That tool is storytelling and stories are what it manifests. Now, that’s the truth.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>J.K.

Yes. You heard me. Don’t graduate.  I’m sure dozens of intelligent people have told you that you need to go to college and get good grades so you can get a good job that will provide good benefits.  Well, the bad news about all of this good news is that it is cruel propaganda.</p><p>Let me explain why. Year after year, I watch you work hard and earn good grades (some of you, at least). You receive honors and awards for your achievements. You eventually graduate and your family comes to your graduation--with gifts and balloons. Once graduation is over, reality drops.  There are few good jobs for you. You move back home to live with your parents (assuming that you left in the first place).  Initially, you have to work jobs that seldom pay well or have anything to do with your major.  Those darn student loan people start calling to remind you about your huge debt and all the special programs you qualify for if you are “experiencing problems meeting your debt obligations.”  You discover that you still have some choices. You can settle for a decent job that pays the bills. You can marry, have children, and spend the rest of your life suspended between debt and death. Or, you can go back to college to graduate all over again.</p><p>I’m here to say—don’t do it.  Don’t graduate twice.  In fact, don’t even graduate once. Instead, I strongly urge you to do something even better and that is “get educated.”  \r If you are confused, then this is a sign that you have probably graduated without being educated. Let me make my point more concrete.</p><p>Do you remember hearing stories about athletes who somehow made it through high school without ever learning how to read or write? Of course, you do. I bet you were just as shocked as everybody else. How in the world could this happen? Didn’t somebody know? Of course, somebody knew. Somebody always knows. But knowing did little to stop those athletes from parading across the stage at graduation—with a diploma.</p><p>They graduated, but they weren’t educated.</p><p>So, here’s the kicker (and you are not going to like it).</p><p>For one moment, I want you to imagine that you are an athlete who graduated uneducated or undereducated. Guess what? This isn’t make-believe. You are that athlete and the athlete is you! Sure, you probably have an A average.  You can read poems in Latin while doing hat tricks, and you are probably on your way to a prestigious university. The fact of the matter is that your magnificent attributes are relative in the educational system.  That diploma puts you and the athlete in the same boat.  He is situated at one end and you at another.  However, your chances of getting out of that boat and going on to a life of success are much better. How does this happen? How does such a stark difference grow out of sameness? When you figure out the answer, you will be on the road toward educating yourself.</p><p>For now, I just hope that you can see the gap between graduating and being educated. No longer do you have to wait and hope someone will explain this complicated reality to you. If you decide you absolutely have to go college, then you must graduate with an education. If not, you will spend the rest of your life in that boat and it’s harder to get out than you think.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>J.K.

This means there has to be a constant inflow of feedbacks on "what" the business needs today and what it might need tomorrow. This philosophy works best when the time taken, to constantly educate the student of the business needs is very low.</p><p>Business needs are changing at a very high pace, so they expect the recruits to be up to date of the recent happennings. For this to happen the instructors at the college have to be on their toes, to understand the new activities. Once they get a complete understanding of the business needs they can very well mould and motivate the students to move in that direction.</p><p>A conventional thought could be one of, "why can''t we achieve this by means of contact sessions between the students and professionals?" It is very much possible but, for all practical reasons its negatives outweigh the positives. We can schedule contact sessions every week or so. But for all practical reasons, all we could have is a couple of contact sessions over a span of 6 months. And we also expect the visiting professional to list out the business needs, which will be very much misunderstood by the students. Because the professional, presents from a businessman''s perspective and transalting it, in terms of educating the students is completely a different task.</p><p>Let us take a typical example of a post graduate school: Iin the fast pace of technological advancements, whatever that is vogue today becomes outmoded tomorrow. So any education that teaches something that is outmoded is of lesser value. This pushes the schools to be agile, and flexible. This nimbleness will directly mould the students to adapt to the latest technology. So once the students are out of the schools, they are very much on their toes, with respect to latest technological shifts and conceptual business changes.</p><p>Let us take a classical example of Jack Welsh ex CEO of GE , he formulated a unconventional management philosophy that "When something is working, it has to be fixed". That is, when something is working, it is bound to die and it has to be fixed soon, before it falls apart. This was very much contradictory to the traditional adage " When something is working, do not touch it". This is a very valuable lesson in terms of management students. Because they are the people who are going to rule the world tomorrow, that means this shift in business has to be imparted to the students. And more than that, they need to be informed whether that principle holds good for any field.</p><p>We can also attribute pessimistice notions to this approach, such as, the instructors will not be able to do justice in handling both the streams (teaching and professional work). But there are many other options, such being a consultant etc, are available for the instructors to be in constant touch with the industry. It is just that they need to run that extra mile to do justice to the students.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>-Ramesh-</p><!--UdmComment-->');

While \r\nacademic discipline is indisputably important, the secret to superior  \r\nperformance is  the power and energy of the body. Embrace the secrets \r\nof the body-mind connection and tap into an inexhaustible supply of \r\npower and energy leading to your college success.', '<p><B>Embrace the secrets of the body-mind connection and tap into an \r inexhaustible supply of power and energy leading to your college \r success.</B> College is a demanding challenge. The role of the \r physical \r body is key to peak performance. This secret tool allows us to summon \r the full measure of our brainpower and talent on demand without \r hesitation. Strong study habits and academic discipline are most \r productive when performed by a brain and a body well fueled and \r precisely tuned. Six key secrets of mind-body performance are nutrition \r (do’s and don’ts), hydration, exercise, sleep and true relaxation.</p><p><B>Secret #1…Focused Nutrition</B>_____ Superior brainpower \r requires high quality fuel. The brain is fueled by oxygenation, hydration \r and proper nutrition, namely carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are \r transformed into glycogen within the body, fueling the muscles and the \r brain. The brain uses 50% of the body’s available glycogen and even \r more when under stress (like during exams). Despite protein’s \r reputation as “brain food”, complex carbohydrates are a far superior \r fuel. Aim for a mix of 2/3 complex carbohydrates and 1/3 protein in your \r meals and snacks. The best strategy to fuel the brain is to begin the day \r with a complex carbohydrate rich breakfast and then eat lightly and \r nutritiously; ‘grazing’ throughout the day.  Be sure to keep the brain well \r supplied with another ‘nutrient’: water.</p><p><B>Secret #2…Diet Downfalls</B>_____ Despite the popularity of low-\r carb weight-loss plans, one of the largest contributors to poor mental \r performance is a diet low in complex carbohydrates. Yet, avoiding \r certain types of food supports high-level brain functioning. Sugary, fatty, \r and many protein heavy foods are poor quality brain fuel. Sugar \r increases anxiety while providing a jittery, scattered rush of energy, \r followed by a dramatic crash in energy, thinking ability and sometimes \r mood. Fats and protein slow the brain and create foggy thinking. It is \r much better to save the cheeseburger or steak until after the exam or \r power-study session.</p><p><B>Secret #3…Ample Hydration</B>_____ Proper hydration is another \r secret component to boosting brainpower. Brain tissue itself is 85% \r water, and the brain is quite sensitive to dehydration. Ample hydration \r allows the brain to function most efficiently, much like grease on gears. \r Conversely, dehydration slows the brain and is a major factor in fatigue. \r Reach for a tall glass of spring water rather than a caffeinated beverage, \r as it will serve you better as a student needing energy and focus. \r Conservative and judicious use of caffeine can be a useful study aid, but \r more often it is overused or abused and has an overall negative effect \r on performance. Be aware that coffee is especially dehydrating. For \r maximum benefit drink 48-64 ounces of water per day. The benefits \r extend far beyond boosting your brainpower to support the health of \r your entire being.</p><p><B>Secret #4…Essential Exercise</B>_____ Exercise nourishes the \r brain with oxygen while cleansing the body of performance damaging \r chemicals. Exercise relieves the body of stress and it’s by-products to \r create clearer, more creative thinking. Exercise trains the body to handle \r stress as well as aiding in recovering from stress. Stress itself is not bad. \r Stress creates growth (mental, physical and emotional), yet the growth \r occurs during a recovery period. Exercise addresses both sides of this \r equation; it can relax as well as increase stress capacity. This is \r especially true when the form of exercise is carefully chosen to create a \r specific effect. For example, a kickbox-aerobics class or long run may be \r the best choice when you feel dull and sluggish or frustrated and \r irritable. Yoga, Chi Gung or a nature walk help soothe nerves and re-\r focus the mind when you feel pressured or anxious. There is a \r physiology to our emotions and it is well established that we learn and \r perform better when we feel good. Exercise is a major key to peak \r performance that powerfully supports academic and personal success \r both in college and in life.</p><p><B>Secret #5…Quality Sleep</B>_____ We underestimate the \r importance of quality sleep and true relaxation on our success. \r However, it is essential. We need at least seven hours sleep for peak \r performance. Naps are great, but not as a substitute for regular sleep. \r Studies actually show that “early to bed, early to rise” really does create \r success. This may be quite a challenge at school, but keep it in mind.</p><p><B>Secret #6…Deep Relaxation</B>_____ College success can be \r derailed by the wrong kind of relaxation. While socializing and ‘partying’ \r has it’s traditional place in college life, they do not fulfill the \r requirements of “deep relaxation.” Highly personal, develop your own \r repertoire of spirit-feeding, body-soothing activities like nature walks, \r playing an instrument, inspirational reading, deep breathing exercises, \r star-gazing, meditating or yoga practice. Eventually you will be able to \r precisely read your body’s signals and take meaningful action to \r enhance your talents and abilities despite any outer stress or \r circumstance.</p><p>Most advice about achieving college success is centered on developing \r excellent study habits. While academic discipline and strong study \r habits are indisputably key factors in college success, there is a \r powerful ‘secret tool’ at work at the very foundation of all our efforts.  \r Achieving meaningful success at college, both academically and \r personally, requires a holistic approach. All mental and emotional \r strategies we may employ are deeply affected by our core foundation: \r the physical body.</p><p>Copyright  2005   Karen B.

What can you do to keep from falling into the trap? Glad you asked, read on to find out.', '<p>Now I remember being a freshman in college, and let me tell you, there are a couple of key things to keep in mind (that most people don''t). One is how to manage your time, another is how to manage your money , and last but certainly not least is how to manage your health (what most don''t realize is that all three are closely related).</p><p>So...why does this happen? \r There are plenty of reasons why poor little freshmen come in skinny (I know... we''ll have to make believe they came in skinny to begin with) and go back home after year one weighing in twenty pounds heavier. For the nerds, studying means munching. Chemistry? Not without chips. Pizza? Yeah, it helps with the math. This is all due to stress that accumulates with the pressure of performing well and acing those exams. Stress leads to "false" hunger; false because you''re not really hungry and just need to do SOMETHING to keep from going crazy. \r Couple this with the fact that you are now on your own (for all of those out-of-towners). Fast food quickly becomes your best friend as its time efficient (even though you procrastinate so that''s really pointless) and keeps the need for cooking knowledge at a basic minimum. Why study the art of making some rice when you can just by a cheeseburger at McDonald''s?</p><p>Most students will make friends, and hence study groups, and hence order this stuff in bulks. Now that you all are doing it together, the problem is magnified. If you showed any restraint before, that all goes out the window and you''ll find yourself asking "can you pass the dip?"</p><p>Not all of the problems are with eating. A main problem is the lack of exercise. Students do not plan for workout time, or maybe classes take over and there IS no time (or at least it feels that way). These (used by themselves or in combination) are usually the excuses that students use when asked "how much do you weigh now?"</p><p>Solutions</p><p>Don''t lose hope! All of these reasons for the freshman fifteen are common...but they are also B.S. excuses. It doesn''t take much for students to keep or even improve their figure. First, if time is a problem, you have to organize a schedule. If you can study math and history, you can also take notes on what to do today. Be focused...treat your health like it is your most important class. Write down goals and male it a point to stick to them. Grade yourself if you have to and strive for an A. And remember to start asap or it will be harder to fix this! \r Quick workouts will be your friend.</p><p>When I was a freshman I barely ever went to the gym, instead I had alternative ways if staying fit. Did you HEAR that? You don''t even have to go to the gym, people! I did two sets of pushups every other morning and jogged for fifteen minutes three times a week (jog a little faster than usual to optimize your workout). That was ALMOST enough to keep me in shape... dieting was just as important.</p><p>Don''t ever buy chips, soda pop, cookies...you will almost surely find those at campus events for FREE. Be smart, don''t waste money on that. Instead, stakeout your local convenience for easy to make rice and meat packages or salads and pasta for vegetarians. Eat small meals often. Have your meals for the day done in the morning so that later all you have to do is serve yourself. Six small meals is much better than one or two big ones.</p><p>Eat healthy snacks. No candy bars. Try Special K bars, granola bars, or protein bars to eat in between classes and meals. Add a sip or two of water and you shouldn''t be too hungry until dinner time. This is good because you avoid eating fattening sweets and avoid eating too much at dinner.</p><p>If you eat less, you will be spending less money and gaining less pounds. There is a correlation there, for those of you that don''t know. We want to fatten up your wallets, not your stomachs. Look for healthy snacks, eat lots of fruit...LOTS of fruit and/or vegetables. In the end, you will look great, feel great, be healthier, and have much higher self-esteem. The best part is you''ll make being healthy a way of life, a habit without knowing it. Just discipline yourself for about 21 straight days. Remember, the sooner the better, and its never too late to start.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Vincent St. James is an author with thecollegeguys.com who specializes in personal fitness as well as personal finance.

You''re alone in the room. Quiet. You sit, close your eyes, roll your head to massage your neck.</p><p>WHAM!! The door flies open and your new roommate charges in with his girlfriend (or guy friend- hey you never know) the friend screaming and bursting in disturbing laughter as your roommate is silent and has this not-quite-well look in his eyes, dragging around a dead hamster, chatting about "I can''t wait to do that again...they''re gonna get what they deserve, Oh sorry [insert your name here], I didn''t see you there." You muster up the ability to hold your tongue and you finally exhale, ever so slowly, "its okay." Like hell it''s ok, you think to yourself.</p><p>This specific scenario describes what happens when your roommate is a "Freak" (learn more about roommate categorization in Part II of this article), and maybe this all sounds too familiar. But there are plenty of other things that can go wrong with a new dorm or apartment roommate. Maybe you''re more of the party type and your roommate thinks bible study is just sooooooo much fun. Maybe your roommate doesn''t know the meaning of "too loud," "maybe later," "lighten up you stiff," or "for the last time, this is MINE, that is YOURS." Like I said, there are plenty of things that can go wrong with the unexpected roommate. Maybe you two just aren''t compatible -but don''t worry- we here at thecollegeguys.com know just what to do.</p><p>Step one is to relax. This kind of thing is normal. You''ll find hundreds if not thousands of others who are in the same position as you are. Its one of those "please don''t happen to me" type of things, and when it does, one is usually unaware of what should be done or how to handle the situation. If you''ve been in this situation, you know what I''m talking about. First, you''re angry and get the whole "why me" syndrome, wishing your roomie was as cool as your friends''. Then you try to avoid the situation as much as possible but when it gets to be too much you experience moments of extreme awkwardness with your room-buddy and anyone else s/he''s associated with. Worse case scenario is that it starts to affect your work or study skills, and when that happens, you KNOW its bad.</p><p>Some problems are really common, such as bathroom use and privacy. The most important things to establish with a new roommate are boundaries. Your roomie needs to know what are off-limits (e.g. shampoo, bag of chips, your box of porn) and what the meaning of space is. The ability to compromise is important in relations among roommates, so you may have to give a little to get a little. You will also have to be frank with your roomie, being clear about what''s your side of the room and about clearing up scheduling conflicts, for example. Scheduling conflicts are particularly important because you don''t want to take home a major project when your roommate has penciled in a yoga session or keg party. Remember, communication is key.</p><p>Now, if you are to sort these issues out with your roommate, its important to do it correctly. You can''t just rush up to your mate and demand that you go over some ground rules...."or else." That won''t do (however, it could be fun). What you need to do is the following: \r <ul>\r <li>Be early: don''t wait until a status quo has been established... you want to make sure that early on in your relationship that you and your roommate are on the same page.</p><p><li>Be sincere: don''t be demanding nor impatient, and try to be understanding of the poor bastard- otherwise, you could make the whole situation come to a head by turning him/her off any compromise whatsoever. Make your roomie believe that you want to help him/her as much as you do yourself.</p><p><li>Be willing to sacrifice: have in mind what you can compromise in return for not using your closet or towels, etc. \r Now not all roommates are the same, as we will see in Part II of this article, so you may have to think twice about how to approach yours. However, follow these basic guidelines, and you should save yourself some headaches later on.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Nostagio Onesti has written several articles specializing in college issues for <a target="_new" href="http://www.thecollegeguys.com">thecollegeguys.com</a> (where you will find Part II to this article and much more).</p><!--UdmComment-->');

This is in sharp contrast with countries like Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America where educational services represent respectively the third, fourth and fifth largest export service.  In contrast to this, the South African Institutions of Higher Education in South Africa have an inclination to address the imbalances of the past, caused by the previous Apartheid Political System.  This national oriented approach has a detrimental effect on Institutions of Higher Education in South Africa’s ability to significantly gain in terms of education export.', '<p>Introduction</p><p>Whilst it is recognized that South Africa is still in a process of transition regarding higher education to address the imbalances of the past, it should also be emphasized that Institutions of Higher Education in large are still underplaying the importance of higher education as commercialized commodity in the global world.  This resulted in a low commercial higher education presence in the global world, a limited capability to attract quality students from foreign countries and a national oriented education approach.  Even the school law that will soon be introduced in South Africa to address the imbalances of the past may have a negative effect of institutions of higher education to play a significant role in the commercialized educational world.  The proposed new law emphasized adherence to the principles of equitability, rectification and representativeness above competence in the appointment of teachers.  This may undermine the quality of education firstly, in schools and later in institutions of higher education in South Africa.</p><p>This is in sharp contrast with international trends signaling that the international higher education market is becoming more competitive as education competes as export and import commodity.  Figures available indicate that higher education export represents on average around 6.6% of total student enrollments in 2000.  This figure can still not be matched b South African Institutions 5 years later.  In countries like Switzerland, Australia and Austria these figures were above 11% in 2000 making these countries the highest internationalized higher education countries in the world.  Similarly, educational services in Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America respectively represent the third, fourth and fifth largest service export sectors.  This clearly provides evidence that these countries realize the significance of higher education to transfer intellectual capital and enhance the economic competitiveness of nations.</p><p>Interventions required</p><p>It is important that Institutions of Higher Education in South Africa position themselves as nodes in an increasingly seamless knowledge base in the global world, which could have a greater interface with the knowledge-driven global economy.  Therefore, Institutions of higher education in South Africa should given even more attention to integrate with influential international institutions that will enable them to internationalize higher education.</p><p>Currently, internationalization of higher education in South Africa happens more by incident rather than through thoroughly planned and organized approaches.  If institutions of higher education in South Africa intend to consider higher education as a commercial trade commodity, serious emphasis should be place upon:</p><p>·	Introducing purposeful policies and strategies that clearly indicate the road forward with regard to internationalization intentions and the specific areas that would need priority attention.  However, this should not be developed as separate internationalization strategies, but should e seen as a natural element of the overall strategy of the institute.</p><p>·	Implementing induction and course programmes that will attract quality foreign students to the institutions.</p><p>·	Supporting academics to participate in conferences as well as in reputable academic journals to publish research results.</p><p>·	Ensuring that all course offerings meet international accepted criteria as defined by the leading institutions of higher education in the developed world.</p><p>·	Creating conducive learning environments equipped with the latest learning technologies.</p><p>Internationalization requires that institutions of higher education in South Africa should emphasize a somewhat loosening of the relationship with Government to create new transformational bodies to address the imbalances of the past, but also to broaden this mission to play a more active role in regional economic development.  This can be achieved by establishing strong horizontal links with other universities research institutions and industry in the Southern African Development Community.  If this can be achieved, the activities of institutions of higher education will no longer be isolated from the marketplace and its outputs could become merchandise products as well.  Loosening the relationship with government will not only provide for more freedom to autonomously decide what educational and research outputs to create, but will also increase the pressure on institutions of higher education to perform better as they take up the responsibility to raise funds for projects and salaries.</p><p>It is imperative that higher education in South Africa can no longer take the disposition that placed research and development in contrast to one another.  Rather, it should take the stand that the outputs of institutions should have a strong:</p><p>·	Social development and application in which the simultaneous promotion and integration of education, scientific research and production occurs;</p><p>·	Science and Technology Financial Management Support System in place in order to create a safe and secure research environment for academics; and</p><p>·	Set of “ Key State Laboratories” where research and education of strategic importance to the development and well-being of the country can be carried out.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>South Africa institutions of higher education currently rated only among the top 40 of the world’s host countries.  An urgent need exist to rethink and reformulate the educational thinking models of institutions of higher education in South Africa.  Because of the changing political situation accompanied by a changing global economy, many traditional ways in which institutions of higher education were previously governed will change.  Unless institutions of higher education in South Africa succeed to internationalize successfully, huge opportunities to earn foreign currencies using higher education as a trade commodity will be lost.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Jan Grundling is the Head of the Centre for Entrepreneurship at Tshwane University of Technology in South Africa.

Therefore, it is not a wonder that many students feel confused on the right college selection as they may not know the way to nail down the advantages that certain colleges have over others. Although many renowned colleges charge higher fees for their courses, the extra costs incurred may not necessarily be justified by the facilities, recognition and educational value that they provide to students.</p><p>For one thing, different online colleges are accredited by different authorities. Therefore, it is important to find out whether the degrees offered are actually accredited by the relevant educational association for your particular state. Otherwise, you may end up having a degree that is not valid and be rejected by your employers. There are also times when colleges may be in the process of getting accredited. Therefore, this information is important to you as their applications for accreditation may be rejected by the authorities later.</p><p>One of the qualifying factors that can be utilized by students to make correct enrolment decisions is by determining the type of college accreditation that has been received by their college of consideration. If the college vaguely states itself as having “nationwide or worldwide accreditation” without stating specifically which regional accreditation body it is accredited with, then most likely this college does not possess legitimate accreditation.</p><p>Once you are certain of a college’s accreditation, you should then determine the history of the college. How many students have graduated as compared to the enrollment numbers? How long has the course been offered? Answering these questions will give you an idea on the level of experience and expertise that the college has to offer for the particular course you want. After all, you are paying them for online education and deserve to get value for your money.</p><p>Apart from that, different colleges will have lecturers of different educational levels. Of course, it would be best that a college have more lecturers with Ph.D. qualifications. Most lecturers should at least possess a Master’s Degree in order for them to qualify teaching an undergraduate course. Again, the quality and quantity of lecturers will give you a good gauge on the standards of the college.</p><p>You can also check on the lecturer-student ratio that the college is proposing. In order for online education to be successful, the lecturer-student ratio should ideally be low. Better colleges will recognize the importance of this, and will ensure that they don’t over-enroll their online students so as to maintain the quality level of their courses. With a low ratio number, students will be assured of having adequate time to work with lecturers.</p><p>Apart from that, different colleges impose different rules on their students. For example, some colleges allow students to go on overdrive mode and complete their credit hours over a shorter period of time. On the other hand, other colleges have a minimum course study period that a student has to adhere to and therefore will not be allowed to accelerate or take up extra credit hours for the course. There is good and bad to both of these scenarios as certain colleges want to ensure quality by not allowing students to sacrifice quality for speed of completion. It is therefore up to the discretion of the student to determine if slowing down on their course would be acceptable to their circumstances.</p><p>Finally, always ask for a hotline number from the online college that you are planning to enroll in. Legitimate colleges will have a number and someone qualified to answer your questions whenever you need help. Call them up before you enroll and test them out by asking a couple of questions. Also, check with them on other numbers and the suitable time that you can call should you encounter problems with your coursework. Through practical experience and gut feeling, you will then be able to make the right decision on choosing the right college for your online education experience.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Rose Musyoka is the editor of <A target="_new" HREF="http://www.distance-learning-college-guide.com">http://www.distance-learning-college-guide.com</a> where you find answers, information and advice on distance learning colleges, accredited online degrees and online courses.

We interviewed a successful university student about the steps she took to find the right college for her. The steps she took in choosing a college can help any prospective student.', '<p>My name is Debbie Ross. The information I have about my journey in finding a college can help both parents and students alike. Going back a few years, I was at the turning point of my life. Graduation from high school was just around the corner and I had no clue which college I was going to attend.  My parents had their list of colleges that I could attend, and most of my friends were already being accepted to their college or university. With deadlines for applications approaching, I knew that I had to begin finding a college.  Choosing the right college is such an important decision, and so I came up with a game plan to find a college.  Here are the steps I took in choosing a college.</p><p><b>1. Choosing my future career</b></p><p>The first step I took was to determine what I liked and what I did not like.  I quickly ruled out being a doctor, a lawyer or a dentist.  In addition, I knew there were career choices that were out of my league, such as being an architect or engineer.  My high school grades proved this!  Therefore after a lengthy thought process, I narrowed down my choices to Communications, Journalism, Business Management and Information Technology.</p><p>My school counselor also helped me by giving me a Career Assessment Test.  This revealed many of my strengths and tendencies.  From this, I discovered that I was best suited for Business Management related studies.  I highly recommend this.  Career Assessment Surveys are not very expensive and can be found through an internet search.</p><p><b>2.  Matching courses with colleges</b></p><p>The next thing I did was to list the colleges and universities that offered Business Management studies and had a good track record.  I used The Fiske Guide to Colleges. Within a short span of time I came up with a list of 20 colleges that I could see myself in for the next 4 years. All of these colleges had multiple specializations within my field of study, were fully accredited, and had good graduation rates with good reputations. I further narrowed my list down to 14 by selecting those universities which were located near a larger city, one of the criteria that I was looking for in my college.</p><p><b>3.  Narrowing it down to my top five</b></p><p>I had above average SAT scores (nothing to take me to Harvard though) and therefore had a wider selection of options for myself. Therefore, my final decision would largely be determined by the funds from my parents, any scholarships or grants, and the money I could earn through on-campus work study. I visited the web sites of each college and took virtual tours of the facilities they offered.  Each had its strengths -huge libraries, modern student housing, student body size, a variety of extra curricular activities and sports, and more.</p><p>I was able to narrow the list from fourteen to five based on the following criteria:  going to college within 4 hours of home, my budget for college, and a smaller student body to offer a more personal approach to my education.</p><p><b>4.  Parents and Applications</b></p><p>Next, I got my parents involved in my decision.  They had been helping me all along the way, but I needed their help in making the final, important decisions.  I showed them the list of 5 colleges that I had, including details, locations, and costs. Together, we narrowed the list to three possible colleges that I could attend. They wanted a college or university which would be easy for them to visit, but would also have excellent teaching and housing facilities.  The following weekend I filled out all 3 applications and mailed out them to these colleges and universities.  Now it was time to wait for the response.</p><p><b>5. Making the final choice</b></p><p>Within a few weeks, I had received acceptance letters from all the colleges where I sent my applications. In the end, my parents and I decided the best way to make the final decision was to visit the campuses. We took two days to visit all three campuses.  Visiting the actual university was vastly different from the virtual tours.  My final choice was actually rather easy. I decided on the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>The most important steps along the way for me were to take the Career Assessment Test, researching my college choices online through virtual tours, and sitting down with my parents to discuss which colleges to send applications to.  This helped make my final decision easier.  I hope these steps can help you in finding a college or university as you make career choices.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Rich Niccolls has been a college recruiter and professor for 12 years.

Even for those who do save, many find that the savings are not enough to cover the full cost of a college education.</p><p>So what should students and parents do to find money for college?  There are many programs available to help students get money for college including scholarships, grants and several types of loans.</p><p>There is one form the student needs to fill out each year which will determine his or her eligibility for need based programs including loans, grants and work-study called the FAFSA, found online at fafsa.ed.gov.</p><p>After submitting the FAFSA students will be notified by mail which programs they qualify for.  Priority deadlines for most colleges are late spring to early summer.  However students can continue to apply until the end of the school year.</p><p>If you have gotten your FAFSA results and didn’t get as much money for college as you need, the first thing you should do is visit the financial aid office at your school.  It is possible that there may be other sources of aid available.  Some colleges participate in state funded financial aid programs and special need based programs that you may qualify for.</p><p>Secondly you can request that the financial aid office review your application and family contribution analysis.  Perhaps there are circumstances such as a job loss, unexpected family expense or another factor that will reduce the amount of money the family is expected to contribute.  This could possibly help you get more money for college in the form of loans and grants.</p><p>Most students qualify for Federal Student Loans (Stafford Loans) and the FAFSA results will reveal the amount students will be able to borrow.  If this loan amount is not enough, students can inquire with the financial aid office about other loans.</p><p>Students may be able to take out additional Stafford Loans in the form of an unsubsidized loan.  Unsubsidized loans are not awarded on the basis of need and students will be charged interest from the time the loan is disbursed until it’s paid in full. Borrowers also have the option to add the interest to the principal amount of the loan until graduation.  However additional interest will be based on the higher amount.</p><p>Other loan options that provide money for college students include Perkins Loans which are designated for students that meet low income criteria.  The availability of Perkins loans are usually limited because each school participating in the Federal Perkins Loan program is given a maximum amount of Perkins Loan funds each year.</p><p>PLUS loans are available for parents to borrow money for college for their children.  These loans are awarded regardless of financial need and allow parents to borrow up to the full cost of the child''s education.  To qualify for a PLUS loan the student must be classified as dependent.</p><p>Knowing your loan options is important but students should not ignore scholarship programs that give away free money for college.  Many students think that scholarships are only available for straight A students, but this is not the case!  There are many college scholarship programs based on a variety of criteria including essay contests, volunteer work or area of study.</p><p>Scholarship money for college can be found by inquiring at your college scholarship office, searching online and using scholarship directories.</p><p>By exploring all of the options available students and their families can successfully find money for college.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Michael Carter is a contributor at College Financial Aid Guide, an online informational resource for educational funding, scholarships and student loans.

We have tuition and food, housing, books... like I said, we need cash. We hear about these billions of dollars of unclaimed scholarship money just floating around, yet you can''t seem to get your hands on any of it, nor on any other form of financial aid. We''re out here working like dogs, trying to make time to study an keep from losing our insanity, until we finally just give up. This sounds like a pretty big problem. What to do?</p><p>First of all, you should know that there aren''t billions of dollars out there just waiting to fall in your lap. In fact most counselors and financial aid assitants wonder why this rather enormous figure is stated so often, but its not the case. So don''t feel bad or think you "suck" because you haven''t won some of this dough. However, there IS some money to be made out there that many people either overlook or figure it isnt worth pursuing. Trust me, its worth taking a look at and worth pursuing.</p><p><b> Usual Suspects </b></p><p>Your first destination should be the government. The FAFSA needs to be the first thing you do. You may be eligible for grants or other special awards. Then go to your school to see if they have any special scholarships that are only available to students of that college or university. After that, sign up to fastweb.com and scholarship.com and become familiar with those two sites, they are two of the most used on the web.</p><p><b>There''s something for everyone!</b></p><p>People commonly think that only minorities and people with really low incomes and awesome grades can get scholarships. This is just not so. There are plenty of scholarships out there that are aimed at people in certain national or local clubs, that serve different interests such as drawing, writing, or a sport, and even some that are strictly for those with work experience. Tons of scholarships for college students are aimed at specific majors and corresponding social networks, for example the Audio Engineering society and American Medical Association. \r Be creative when searching. There are plenty of companies giving money away in hopes of attaining a student base of prospective future employees. If you''re working on computers, for example, see what top technological companies such as Qualcomm and IBM have to offer, if you''re working in finance and economics, checkout some big time (and small time) Wall St. corporations, for instance.</p><p>Also, don''t forget to checkout your own community. YMCA, churches, local youth groups and sports teams, they all give out money to deserving individuals, so do some homework on your hometown before moving on to bigger venues.</p><p><b>The essay contest</b></p><p>These are wonderful. Checkout what you like, what you know a lot about and are passionate about, and write an essay to submit to a contest or scholarship offer. Get friends in on it...help each other out and promise to share earnings.</p><p><b>Why isn''t this EASY? </b></p><p>Now, I don''t want to brag, but I won quite a few scholarships in my day. However, I remember always getting questions about "how do you do it," "you''re so lucky," and so on. Well, it really isn''t that complicated-- its going to take some work and dedication. Start early, make a list of scholarships, plan for scholarship-work time, and get busy. Don''t feel bad when you don''t win, most students are happy to win a few because that''s usually what it takes. Just keep focused on what you''re trying to do, hope for the best, and do NOT stress out about it.</p><p><b>Alternatives</b></p><p>There are a few alternatives. Never resort to credit cards. Ever. What you want to look for are student loans because they have lower interest rates and usually have friendlier grace periods and payback periods. Don''t worry about being in student loan debt upon graduation...$10000-$15,000 is not bad at all (if being repaid in ten years). \r Stafford loans are the most common. They offer around $2600 for first-year, $3500 for second year and $5500 for third year students. Perkins loans usually don''t have to be repaid until nine months after graduation and you have 10 years to pay. Checkout private loans, maybe from loan-specialists companies and your own school. Checkout the American Education Society which also provides private loans for people.</p><p><b>Don''t Stress It </b></p><p>There is money to be made, just be focused, dont''t get discouraged, and work hard at it.

This article gives tips on choosing the best online university for your needs.', '<p>A college degree gives a person a guarantee of higher wages and a better job. Sadly, many Americans continue to go on without having a college degree. Using an online university is a great way to get a degree while still keeping a job, or taking care of a family. There are numerous online universities out there, and it is up to you to decide which one is best. The best online university should fulfill all of your needs and provide a solid education. Here are a few tips that are good to follow when choosing an online university.</p><p>1. Choose a university with a plethora of class options. If you need to still keep a job and take care of your family, than you want to have the ability to have flexible classes. Some online universities offer more classes than others. The more classes a university has, the easier it will be for you to explore and find a field of study that interests you. People always are most successful with a field of study that they are interested in.</p><p>2. In addition to offering a wide variety of classes, it is always good to choose an online university with a great amount of degrees. Some online universities only offer a select few degrees. Having a limited amount of degrees keeps class options to a minimum and you may find yourself with a degree in a field of study that you’re not interested in. The goal of an online university education is to provide you with a useful degree that you will be able to use in order to get an enjoyable job. In order to find what’s best for you, having many degree options and class options is very important.</p><p>3. Choose the university with the best costs for your situation. Some universities charge more or less than others, and it is up to you to decide what cost best fits your needs. Search for universities in a specific cost range pre-determined by you. You should not be afraid of either extreme, however. If you cannot afford the highest cost education, than the cheapest online university will still be significantly better than no education. At the same time, if you a very interested in a specific university’s degree programs, but are afraid of the cost, you should enroll anyway. The value of higher education surpasses any initial costs and you will be happier when you are learning what you want to learn.</p><p>4. Finally, look at the online universities reputation. There are a few web sites in existence that give information about online universities. Some web sites rank online universities in certain areas of study. Having a degree from a university with a high reputation can help you get a better job than you might have had with a less-reputable university degree.</p><p>Take the time to research and make sure that you are getting a solid degree. Research is the best way to ensure a successful online university endeavor. The more you know about what you are looking for, and what’s available, the easier it will be to make a decision. Getting a college degree is a great idea, and you should give your best effort to find the university that’s right for you.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>John McGovern is interested in online university education and writes for Online University Lowdown (<a target="_new" href="http://www.onlineuniversitylowdown.com">http://www.onlineuniversitylowdown.com</a>).</p><!--UdmComment-->');

The outcome of this research provides valuable insights regarding the perceived competitive profile employed by various institutions in South Africa.', '<p><b>Introduction and Literature Review</b></p><p>South African education policies place priority on addressing historical education imbalances, but should also be sensitive to the demands of an ever-increasing global knowledge-driven environment.  The educational system cannot be dominated by the needs of the domestic educational system of South Africa ignoring the trends exerted by the global world (OEDC Annual Report, 2004:44).  Higher education in South Africa should realize that they operate and function in a knowledge-driven global environment in which both domestic and foreign students demand access to the best quality education at the best reputable institutions of higher education in the world.</p><p>In this regard, most definitions of internationalization of higher education include the following:  “Internationalisation is a process that prepares the community for successful participation in an increasingly interdependent world …  The process infuse all facets of the post-secondary education system, fostering global understanding and developing skills for effective living and working in a diverse world” (Francis, 1993 cited by Patrick, 1997).</p><p>The position of higher education in South Africa should be evaluated considering the re-integration of South Africa into the global community.  South Africa was rapidly re-integrated into the world community by obtaining almost immediate membership of influential international organisations after 1994.  Kishun (1998:59) indicated that South Africa became a member of among others the following international institutions:  United Nations; Organisation of African Unity; Commonwealth; International Olympic Committee; Federation of International Football Associations; and Lome Convention.  Integration of influential international institutions is a necessary but not sufficient pre-condition for internationalization of higher education.  Sustainable internationalization should be closely aligned to the emerging global trends and events in the education sector.</p><p>An analysis of the basis on which internationalization of higher education occurs is needed as well as the benefits of the internationalization process.  This research is conducted against this background.</p><p><b>Problem Statement</b></p><p>Whilst South Africa is in a process of transition regarding higher education to address the imbalances of the past, the question arises whether the South African educational sector is able to compete in the global economy which regard knowledge as a commercialised commodity.</p><p><b>Methodology</b></p><p>A sample size of 781 respondents from six institutions of higher education in South Africa was selected.  Senior students were randomly selected using the convenience sampling technique.  A semi-structured questionnaire was developed to measure the perceived competitive profile of institutions of higher education in South Africa.  The questionnaire constitutes five measuring foci, namely:</p><p>·	Section A:  Institutional information regarding the location where the respondent is enrolled.</p><p>·	Section B:  Biographical information in terms of gender, type of student and country of origin.</p><p>·	Section C:  Decision criteria used to select an institution of higher education.</p><p>·	Section D:  Four competitive dimensions of higher education institutions, including strategic competitiveness, institutional competitiveness, product competitiveness, and tactical competitiveness.</p><p>·	Section E:  Open-ended questions, aimed to identify the reasons why respondents choose a specific institution of higher education, their opinion on the institution’s competitive reputation, and the factors that may influence the international competitiveness of the particular institution.</p><p>The data was transformed into two opposite categories, namely those who agreed with the statements and those who disagreed, enabling the researchers to derive a hypothesized agreement-disagreement distribution.  Those who neither agreed nor disagreed were allocated to the disagreement group set giving and expected disagreement response set of 57% (p=0.57) and an agreement response set of 43% (q=0.43).  The Binomial test was employed to determine whether the observed distribution correspond with the hypothesized distribution using a significance test level of 0.05.  Furthermore, the level of agreement or disagreement with the selected competitive statements and the extend of agreements between the respondents from the different institutions on the various statements were determined by executing four statistical procedures, namely:  ANOVA to compare the means of respondents from the different institutions; determining how much of the perception variation could be accounted for by the influence of the different institutions of higher education;  determining the averages for each strategic dimension to obtain an indication of the level of agreement with the competitive statements; and determining the standard deviations to obtain an indication of the extend to which consensus exists within the sample.</p><p><b>Findings</b></p><p>With regard to the strategic competitiveness of South African institutions of higher education to engage in a seamless network the respondents were of the opinion that South African institutions of higher education give low priority to attract foreign students, are not well known for attracting foreign students, are not actively involved in exchange programmes of students and lecturers, and do not have active engagements or agreements with other tertiary institutions, businesses and communities.</p><p>On the issue of institutional competitiveness, the majority of respondents were of the opinion that institutions of higher education in South Africa have the ability to attract quality students, does not have an international student culture, offers qualifications that are internationally accepted, can claim international reputability on post-graduate level, offers competitive tuition fees, deliver research outputs that are internationally recognized, and are not easily accessible.</p><p>In terms of product competitiveness the majority of respondents indicated that institutions of higher education in South Africa have active orientation programmes to familiarise foreign and domestic students with the institutions, provide safe and secure learning environments, provide leading information technology for academic growth and excellence, do not easily adapt to the needs and wants of students, and provide convenient service packages to students.</p><p>With regard to tactical competitiveness institutions of higher education in South Africa have the ability to compile a diploma or degree offering that meets or exceeds international standards in terms of offering subject content of international standard, having internationally acclaimed staff, aggressively marketing its qualifications internationally, claiming international acceptable through-put, and having acceptable grant and loan schemes accessible to students.</p><p><b>Conclusion and Recommendations</b></p><p>The majority of respondents are in agreement that institutions of higher education in South Africa are able to compete internationally on the four competitive dimensions (strategic, institutional, tactical and product).  Internationalisation requires that institutions of higher education in South Africa should emphasise a somewhat loosening of the relationship with Government, despite the paradoxical need to create new transformational bodies to address the imbalances of the past.  Internationalisation of higher education implies that internationalised institutions operate on new super ordinate levels which has its own legal, administrative and revenue-raising powers.</p><p>In terms of strategic direction institutions of higher education might consider at least one of the following internationalization approaches:</p><p>·	“Would-be internationalization”:  Applies to academics and institutions wanting to be involved in internationalization but facing problems in being considered on equal terms.</p><p>·	“Life or death internationalization”:  Countries, their academics and institutions, which view internationalization cooperation as indispensable for their status and role in the global world.</p><p>·	“Two areas”:  Academics and institutions have the option of striving for either more national or more international status and orientation.  The academic field in which one is operating often determines this.</p><p>·	“Internationalisation by import”:  Countries and institutions that treat internationalization only as coming from outside, by hosting foreign students and publishing research.  It should not represent a separate strategy towards internationalisation.</p><p><b>References</b></p><p>Kishun, R.  1998.  Internationalization in South Africa.

At Cashzilla, we’re not entirely sure where they get this figure as most graduates start well below this – sometime as low as £12,000.  that’s not much money at all when you owe more that that in student debt.</p><p>But still as unimaginative schools and parents coax their kids into three (or more) years of vacant academia, it takes a gutsy 18 year old to take a long term approach to what they may wish to do with their life.</p><p>It is true that there will always be careers that demand a university education, but many young people get pushed on to the higher education conveyer belt, without any idea of what they’re doing there.  If there was a booming graduate jobs market at the end of the production market – vacant graduates would be fine.</p><p>But there are real concerns about how crowded the universities are becoming and how students are managing their finances.  It is a phenomenal burden to allow students to borrow such significant amount of money and then watch them struggle for employment upon graduation.  Even when they get a job, many find it doesn’t meet the high expectations pumped into them at university.  No wonder the “quarter life crisis” has become a lifestyle segment.</p><p>If you are a student, graduate or university virgin, you must read Damian Barr’s article “Crying on the inside” from Times Online (http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8123-1093294,00.html), it’s a superb summary of life as a British twenty-something.  On a slightly more practical, but just as constructive note, there is an abundance of advice and support available on the internet.  "Support 4 Learning" is a superb site (<a target="_new" href="http://www.support4learning.org.uk/money/index.htm">http://www.support4learning.org.uk/money/index.htm</a>) and moneynet offers an excellent <a target="_new" href="http://www.moneynet.co.uk/student-finance-guide/index.shtml">student finance guide</a>, but don’t get distracted by searching for additional loans and credit cards!</p><p>By all means go to university and have lots of fun, but bear in mind that the graduate market is hugely competitive … and again … t h e   g r a d u a t e   m a r k e t   i s   h u g e l y   c o m p e t i t i v e.  We would rather see young people take some time out to work, travel and gain experience before embarking on a hedonistic journey of sex, drugs and rock and roll.  Yes you have the right to an education, but remember that education does not always lead to freedom, especially with the current price of a degree.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Rachel writes for the personal finance blog Cashzilla.</p><p>Rachel lives in Edinburgh (currently over-run with tourists) with Cat, blonde Andy and brunette Andy.</p><!--UdmComment-->');
INSERT INTO `CareerArticles` (`cat_id`, `title`, `file_name`, `author`, `short_desc`, `body`) VALUES (16, 'Balancing College Life and Academics', 'Balancing-College-Life-and-Academics', 'Andy Masters', 'A college career can be one of the best times of people’s lives.  It can also be one of the most challenging.  Serving on event programming boards, student government, Greek organizations, and other extra-curricular activities can be stressful, and sometimes overwhelming.  Below are several keys to be sure you get the most out of your college career, helping prove that you can lead by example both inside and outside the classroom.', '<p>1.  Control Your Schedule; Don’t Let Your Schedule Control You</p><p>Organization and time management skills are two of the most valuable skills you will ever have.  One of the first things you should do at the beginning of each semester is organize the dates of all class tests and project deadlines from each syllabus, and all required meetings and events from each organization.  All obligations should then be logged into a centralized schedule you keep at all times, such as a daily planner, desk calendar, or even a PDA (personal digital assistant).  For the next 4 months, you now know exactly what you must schedule the rest of your life around.</p><p>Next, it is highly recommended for you to set a schedule for yourself in writing to include all other items you want to create as a routine.  Most importantly, this should include times of study, such as every Tuesday and Thursday from 3:30 – 6:30.  Physically block off these time periods every Tuesday and Thursday for the rest of the semester.  Of course, the most important part of creating a schedule is sticking to it!  So, be disciplined enough to schedule any other activities that are less important around those that are most important.</p><p>2.  Ask For Help When You Need It</p><p>Whether it involves academics or organizational responsibilities, everyone comes to a point where they feel overwhelmed.  This is what friends, fellow members, and other university resources are there for.  Unfortunately, there are several reasons why people don’t seek help when it is available.  Some people try to take on too much, trying to prove to themselves that “I can do this all on my own.”  Some may not want to admit to people that they “can’t handle everything.”  Others may feel they must do everything all on their own, because only then will they know it will get done right and on time (an early signal of being a control freak).  However, delegation is a learned skill, and (when used properly) can actually aid in tasks being completed quicker, with less mistakes, and less stress.</p><p>Academically, seek out help when you don’t understand something.  There should be plenty of resources available, from writing centers, to computer labs, to graduate assistants, to your professors who offer office hours.  There are also other students who may understand that subject better, or who have even taken the course before.  Especially in very large classes, some students may be intimidated to ask for help.  But, the sole purpose of the institution and all of these resources is to help you learn.  So use them.  Ask for rope to be thrown down before you drown!</p><p>3.  Keep A Firm Grasp On Your Priorities</p><p>Understanding what your PRIORITIES are each and every day is one of the biggest keys to college success.  It is also one of the easiest concepts to lose track of.  It is a fast-paced world, where it is easy to become sidetracked with social activities, TV shows, video games, etc.  Some people carry a card in their wallet, or even a post a card on their PC, where they list the top 1-5 priorities in their life.  The card says “Is what I am doing RIGHT NOW with my time directly contributing to one of my top priorities in life?”  If the answer is “No,” then that serves as a good reminder that you could be doing something more important.</p><p>Everyone has exactly 24 hours each day.  People who achieve more in life simply make better use of their 24 hours each day than everyone else.  What you do with each of your 24 hours has as much to do with your success during college as any other factor.  There is an old saying that “if it important enough to you, you make time for it.”  Be sure that nobody is in charge of your time except for you.  It is one of the most valuable assets you have.</p><p>4.  Don’t Wait Until the End of Your College Career to Stop Procrastinating (Get It?)</p><p>Whether it is an event or a semester project that is two months away, ask yourself each day “What can be done now instead of later?”  Write down when you are going to do something, not simply when something is due.  Set deadlines for yourself, and put them in writing.  Then stick to it.  Most people procrastinate because the activity they are supposed to do is not as desirable as what they would rather be doing.  However, if you complete tasks early, you can enjoy your leisure time worry-free.  This is one of the biggest ways to alleviate stress.</p><p>If it is the 3rd day of the month, and there is a project due on the 28th of the month, most students hardly have that project on the radar screen yet.  Then, they see the project creep up on their calendar on the 24th or 25th, and they say “Uh-oh!”  Further, they realize there is an event planned on the 26th, and they have to work at their part-time job on the 27th!  This lack of planning is what leads to either missed deadlines, or turning a project in on time, but with poor quality.  In addition to poor quality, it also led to undue stress for 4 days.  One easy way to tackle projects ahead of time is to break the project down into several smaller ones.  For example, instead of writing a 10-page paper in one night, write 1-page per day for 10 days, or 1-page every other day.  This will save time, increase quality, and decrease stress.</p><p>5.  Go to Class</p><p>That’s right.  Skipping class is one of the most dangerous, yet tempting habits on college campuses today.  Sure, you might be able to miss a class here and there—perhaps even miss a lot of classes—and still pass if you cram hard enough.  However, don’t make things hard on yourself, make things easy.  The more you attend class, the less you have to study, and the more time you have for the everything else you want or need to do.  Professors also have a way of telling you what will be on the test, and explaining the answers in class—but you are only privy to that if you are actually in class.</p><p>Try to get in the habit of forcing yourself to sit in the FRONT of the class, especially in large classes.  Studies show that students retain more information, and pay more attention, even if they don’t realize it.  It also helps keep you awake. That usually allows you to take better notes, as well. And make sure the professor knows your name!</p><p>6.  Find a Mentor or Example of a Great Student Lifer in your Organization</p><p>Almost every organization has one or more students who are shining examples of the balance between extra-curricular activities and academics.  They make the Dean’s List every semester, hold an important office in the organization, work part-time, and even have a girlfriend or boyfriend.  Everyone seems to ask “How do they do it?”</p><p>So, are they smarter than you?  In most cases, ABSOLUTELY NOT!  There have been literally millions of college students that were “smart enough” to graduate, but who failed in the areas of time management, priorities, and responsibilities.  So, understand the habits of those who are successful at balancing college life and academics.  Ask them what their secrets are, and hey will surely be willing to help. Follow the habits of those who are succeeding, not the ones you struggle.  Makes sense, doesn’t it?</p><p>7.  Have Fun!</p><p>Ok, so most college students don’t need help with this tip, right?  However, enjoy it while you can--you are only in college once!  Many Americans recall their college days as the best time of their life.  Believe it or not, professors, administrators, and us college speakers want you to enjoy every minute if it!  Making efficient use of your time and controlling your schedule are important ingredients in being able to enjoy yourself.  They allow you to alleviate stress and succeed both inside and outside the classroom, so you can have a BLAST during your college career.  Good luck!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Andy Masters is a nationally recognized speaker, and author of the book "Life After College:  What to Expect and How to Succeed in Your Career."

But here’s the news flash: The prescription probably won’t work. Why? Free advice is usually forgettable advice. And guess what I’m offering? More advice. But guess what? It is sensible and forgettable.</p><p>Lesson #1:  Be honest about your abilities and goals</p><p>If you don’t want to go to college, then don’t go. You will only be frustrated and miserable. Forcing yourself to attend college will kill your motivation. It takes dedication and persistence to finish. If you are dying to work as a poodle-groomer after high school, then do that.</p><p>If you do go to college, be sure you are prepared. The stunts you pulled in high school might not go over so well with college professors.  If you were undisciplined before college, you will likely be undisciplined in college and you will likely not meet your main goal—which is to graduate on time.  Don’t make a career out of being a college student.  The pay is awful.</p><p>Lesson #2:  Figure out the college zone</p><p>There are many different types of colleges and universities from which you can choose.  The better your academic record, the more choices you have. Each college or university has a specific mission or purpose. Knowing what that purpose is isn’t vital. But you do need to visit the campus and talk to some professors and students in order to determine if that particular institution is right for you.  The school you choose should fit you. You shouldn’t try to fit the school.</p><p>Lesson #3:  Don’t dig a big money pit</p><p>The cost of higher education continues to go up.  It is likely that you will acquire debt in order to finance your education. Fine. But be wise.  Getting admitted to a college or university doesn’t necessarily mean you can afford it. The truth is that you can get a good education at a cheap school. Prestige is beneficial; however, what really matters most is not the school itself but the professors who teach there.  The job market for college teachers has been saturated for years. It is not uncommon to find PhD’s from prestigious universities teaching at small state colleges and community colleges. So, it is very possible to get a first rate learning experience for a fraction of the cost.</p><p>Of course, you’ve probably heard that student loan debt is “good debt.” If it is so good, try missing a few loan payments and see what happens.  It won’t be all hugs and kisses.</p><p>Lesson #4:  Know that the money is in the major</p><p>Yes. You should major in something that you love. Sometimes, doing what you love does not pay the bills. If your first love is money, then preparing to enter a field that will provide you with opportunities to make money is very pragmatic. The trick is to find balance. Major in something that you love and that brings you the amount of money that will allow you to be comfortable, if not rich. By the way, capitalism requires only a few rich people and many not-so-rich people. Which group will you be in?</p><p>Lessons #5: Get the experience you need to get the job you want</p><p>The degree that you earn will not be enough in today’s competitive workforce. You will need experience and you will not gain experience until you get a job.  No one will offer you a job because you lack experience. You know the cycle is cruel. However, there is something that you might not know:  While in college, you can offer your labor for free as an intern or volunteer.  Your pay is the experience you gain and the relationships you establish with people in the workforce.  You become more employable when you know someone who knows someone who used to work for someone who is now the boss at the place where you applied for a job.</p><p>Lesson #6:  Learn how to fail</p><p>The reason most people do not succeed is because they never learn the art of failing.  When you accept the fact that failing is a part of success, then you are less prone to fear failure.  The fear of failure makes you apprehensive about taking risks.  You should not interpret these comments as an excuse to fail courses—although this does happen sometimes. I’m advising you to learn to be resilient in spite of the obstacles you encounter.  No guts, no glory.</p><p>Lesson #7:  Develop a critical imagination</p><p>You should attend all of your classes—not because all of your professors will be lively and inspirational teachers. Most of them won’t be. You should go to class to learn how to think critically and use your imagination. What do I mean?  Learn to investigate, analyze, and question the ideas that you encounter in the various courses you take.  More importantly, learn to challenge those ideas and try to discover new ways to think about them.  How? All you have to do is use your imagination to develop those ideas.  If your idea is different, quirky, weird, or whatever, stick with it and be passionate about it. That idea distinguishes you from the crowd. Don’t just think outside the box. Ask why a box is necessary and who does it belong to and why can’t you have your own.</p><p>Lesson #8:  Don’t become an island</p><p>The years you spend at a college or university will offer you opportunities to meet a variety of people and develop lasting friendships. Use this time to your advantage. Everyday you spend on campus provides you with a chance to network. Keep a list of the people you meet and where you met them. Catalog their contact information and keep this information updated.  I know you are probably thinking that most alumnae associations take care of this stuff.  Don’t count on it. Do it yourself.  Always remember, an old acquaintance is better than no acquaintance at all.</p><p>Lesson #9:  Don’t Graduate</p><p>You will forget most of what you learn in college before you graduate.  Knowledge that is not used regularly dies very quickly. Don’t think that once you graduate that your education is over. The world of work changes constantly and you will probably find yourself being retrained on the job or having to go back to college for refresher courses. The workforce will teach you everything you didn’t learn in school and much more.  Don’t be surprised at how embarrassingly different these two worlds are and how much you have to learn and relearn.  Life is about learning, and it will never allow you to graduate.  So don’t do it.  Don’t graduate. You can forget everything else...except that.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>J.K.

And if you experience severe brain fog, concentration and memory problems, it can be a near-to-impossible feat. But if you **do** feel well enough to study, there **are** options out there which can make things a lot easier for you.</p><p>So what do you do if you want to study but have CFS/ME/PVFS?</p><p>Well if your condition is moderate-to-severe then taking a term- or year-out to recover from your condition is definitely worth considering. But for some of us this just isn''t an option.</p><p>In addition, some of us may already be studying a course when we first develop this condition. Not wanting to stop the course, it is not uncommon for us to try to carry on, regardless of our struggles to keep up with the course''s pace and intensity.</p><p>What''s more, often it''s not a case of ''just managing your course'' either. If only it were that simple! College and university life opens up a ''brave new world'' of socializing, parties, and events - things that most CFS/ME/PVFS sufferers struggle to keep up with, if at all.</p><p>----- SIDE NOTE -----</p><p>Alcohol for example, can play a big role in socializing, especially at university. But many (if not most) CFS/ME/PVFS sufferers are alcohol-intolerant so beware!</p><p>Check out the article below for more info:</p><p><a target="_new" href="http://www.sleepydust.net/The_Sleepydust_EMagazine-sleepydust-ezine-issue-001.html#art1"> http://www.sleepydust.net/The_Sleepydust_EMagazine-sleepydust-ezine-issue-001.html#art1</a></p><p>----- SIDE NOTE -----</p><p>From a personal perspective, studying with CFS/ME/PVFS is something I''m very familiar with. I was diagnosed with Post Viral Fatigue Syndrome (PVFS) in the second term of my first year at university, so most of my university-life was spent as a PVFS sufferer.</p><p>Although the PVFS wasn''t nearly as bad as it is now, I still had to battle with the brain fog, exhaustion, weakness and the many other dreadful symptoms that come with it. That was in addition to the emotional stress of getting used to the illness and the restricted lifestyle it imposed on me. In fact, not being able to do as much as I would like to is **still** something I''m trying to get used to even now!</p><p>Many students move away from their home to study further a field. And while that often can make sense for a healthy individual, I think that in some cases, the strain of living on your own/with friends/in halls/dorms can make coping with CFS/ME/PVFS even more difficult.</p><p>When I was a university student I lived away from home,  firstly in halls, and then with friends. I studied full-time but with hindsight I think that studying **part-time** would have lifted a lot of the stress for me. The pace would have been slower and I may have even been able to attend more classes too (I missed many of them).</p><p>With hindsight, I think that it may have been easier if I had considered either:</p><p>1) going to a **local** university or college and studying **part-time** or;</p><p>2) opting for a ''home study'' course (distance learning).</p><p>So if you feel that you can study but perhaps not full-time, then going part-time could be an option for you. And if you feel that you are not able to manage a full-time or even part-time course, then home study (distance learning) can be a viable option.</p><p>I think that living in the home environment while you study may make it much easier on you (if your home environment is a safe, calm environment and if you are surrounded by people who know and care for you).</p><p>Studying when you have CFS/ME/PVFS **is not** a decision to be taken lightly, particularly if you are considering moving far from your familiar home environment and studying full-time. That is not to say that it cannot be done, because it can. But how well you manage will be largely affected by your living and course arrangements, and the severity of your illness.</p><p>That doesn''t mean there aren''t ways around it! The location of your university/college, and the length of your course/ frequency of your classes can all have a bearing and this is especially relevant when you study as a CFS/ME/PVFS sufferer. So bear this in mind. Try to keep your options open and don''t rule out taking a term- or year-out, part-time study or home-study.</p><p>The second half of this article will feature in another issue of the Sleepydust E-magazine, where we''ll take a look at studying techniques and exams.</p><p>To read more tips about how to manage and deal with your ME and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome visit:</p><p><a target="_new" href="http://www.sleepydust.net/MYALGIC-ENCEPHALOPATHY-cfsme-homepage.html"> http://www.sleepydust.net/MYALGIC-ENCEPHALOPATHY-cfsme-homepage.html</a></p><p>And to learn more about working from home when you are chronically ill or disabled, visit:  <a target="_new" href="http://www.sleepydust.net/WORK-FROM-HOME.html"> http://www.sleepydust.net/WORK-FROM-HOME.html</a></p><p>Copyright, Claire Williams, 2004-2005.

This article lists some strategies to help you create an optimal learning environment.', '<p>Living in an apartment during college can be the highlight of a student''s life. You''re away from home, living with friends. You don''t yet have the stresses of a full time job. You only have a few hours of class a day. And there are always opportunities for fun. How can you maximize this chance to live while still keeping school your priority?</p><p>First, it''s important to have a common understanding amongst your roommates that school is the priority during the week. Everyone has different class schedules, so for some of your roommates Thursday night is the weekend or perhaps Wednesday''s classes don''t start until the afternoon. Hopefully you chose roommates who will be courteous enough to understand that you have a different schedule then they do.</p><p>If weeknight partying continues despite your reminders, you may have to scout out some alternate study zones. In my experience, obvious studying areas such as the library or a coffee shop near campus are poor choices. They are typically overrun with students and can, ironically, get quite distracting. Look instead to some smaller study areas around campus or perhaps a nearby public library.</p><p>If the problem isn''t just getting your studying done, but getting your sleep in, things are much more serious. It would be ridiculous to start sleeping somewhere else since your spending hundreds of dollars a month to stay at your apartment. At this point, a more serious confrontation with the offending roommates may be in order.</p><p>In such a confrontation, roommate alliances will play a major role. If you''re up against three other party people, there may not be much you can accomplish unless you get an authority involved. However, at this point do you really want to continue living with these people? You may need to start looking for a new place to live in this extreme case. \r Otherwise, you can probably work out an agreement. Restraining from hosting weeknight parties will seem reasonable to most people when you explain your 8:00 classes.</p><p>Keeping the communication channels open is vital to living with college roommates. Always be willing to give a little and chances are they will return the favor. Keep on the lookout for some out of the way study spaces so you can get out of your apartment and remember to maintain good relationships with your roommates in case you need their backup.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p><i>Ian Byrd runs websites dedicated to helping <a target="_new" href="http://www.uciapartments.net">UCI</a> and <a  target="_new" href="http://www.ucla-housing.com">UCLA students find housing</a>.</i></p><!--UdmComment-->');

As a student, you are immediately judged as a risk. You don''t have a good job and probably only work part time since school is your focus. You carry the “college student” stigma, bringing to mind parties, late nights and loud music.</p><p>Furthermore, there is intense competition for apartments near college since everyone moves in at the same time. Apartment owners whose complexes are near campus can be very selective since their facilities are in such demand. They can also charge higher prices and many will be willing to pay.</p><p>So how can you possibly find a decent apartment near your college campus without getting gouged?</p><p>The easiest way to find more affordable housing is to look a couple miles away from campus. Housing within walking distance comes with a premium. Once you get a few miles away, prices drop noticeably. What about parking and driving costs? If the weather allows, a bike costs almost nothing. Otherwise, carpool with your roommates. With either  solution, the money you save on rent every month will quickly pay for a parking permit or a bike.</p><p>You can also check out some alternative housing ideas. Although it may sound silly, trailer parks can offer great deals if you can get a hold of an RV for cheap. You can also look into renting a room from a family or even, perhaps with your parents'' help, buying a house in the area. Think of it as an early graduation gift.</p><p>But if you''re really want that housing next to campus and your lack of income is a problem with the landlord, look to getting a cosigner. Your parents or one of your roommate''s parents can sign on, agreeing to make your rent if you fail to. Of course, if you really think you''ll have a problem making rent, you should be looking further away. It will certainly strain relations with your parents if they''re suddenly footing your rent.</p><p>Before signing up with the high priced apartments near your college campus, be sure to check out housing options further away.

Complete freedom, a few hours of school, and little parent involvement combine for some crazy times. Unfortunately, there is the side of apartment living that is not so fun: paying rent and bills.</p><p>As a young person, your first year in an apartment will most likely be the first time you''ve ever had the responsibility of keeping track of and paying for bills. To make thins more difficult, you have to work with your roommates to get it all paid for. Here are a few tips to make sure it all goes smoothly.</p><p>First, you need to have a meeting to get everyone on the same page regarding rent. Make sure everyone knows how much they are paying each month. Put one person in charge of getting the big check to the landlord. You can switch this off monthly to make it less responsibility, but this will make things a little more complicated. Have a hard set date when everyone''s checks are due so that there is enough time to assemble the big check. Keeping on top of this can really help the monthly process.</p><p>Bills are another complicated issue. Again, you can put one person in charge of all the bills and have every give them their share of the money each month. If someone is responsible and willing to do this, go for it. Also, split up the bills as simply as possible. Obviously dividing it equally is the easiest way to go. Sometimes, however, people will claim that they don''t watch cable TV or don''t want to pay for certain features that other people wanted. If their claim is true, then let them pay less. Otherwise, stick to a simple payment plan.</p><p>Communication is key to keeping money matters simple. As long as everyone knows the procedures and people stay on top of it, you shouldn''t have any problems getting the rent and bills in.

The college you choose will eventually receive your final \r semester grades and if they are significantly lower than the rest of your \r transcript, it could jeopardize your offer of admission.  All college \r acceptance letters clearly state that your offer is contingent on your \r maintaining the same level of academic and personal excellence that \r made you such a strong applicant in the first place.  So whatever you do, \r don’t slack off, either academically or personally.  Don’t give them any \r reason to change their minds.  In fact, senior year provides a crucial \r opportunity to prove that you can handle the rigors of a selective \r college.  I am often asked the question, “Can I drop a course or take an \r easier load senior year?  Haven’t I already proved myself enough \r through my junior year?”  The answer, unfortunately, is no.  Senior year \r should actually be your most rigorous academic year yet—if anything, \r we recommend stepping up the number of honors and AP classes.  \r Senior year is also a time to think about studying for an AP \r independently.  By self-studying for an AP exam, you can demonstrate \r an extra commitment to your area of interest that will be impressive to \r colleges.  Additionally, you have much more freedom to pursue study in \r a subject area that truly interests you.</p><p>Here’s an interesting scenario: We had a student last year who applied \r to her #1 choice,  Harvard, through their Single-Choice Early Action \r option.  She had actually lightened her courseload senior year: Despite \r the fact that English was her passion and her strength area, she decided \r to drop English altogether during her senior year, having already \r fulfilled her high school’s English requirements.  She was deferred into \r Harvard’s regular applicant pool, left to wait until April for the final word.</p><p>The agony of waiting for her decision grew more and more intense.  She \r realized she had to step it up academically, especially during her \r second semester.  She worked as hard as she possibly could on her \r grades and even started an independent reading project during which \r she read approximately 30 novels from the Western canon on her own.  \r In April of her senior year, she found out she had been put on Harvard’s \r waitlist.  Clearly, Harvard had wanted to see her end-of-year final \r grades to make sure she was keeping up academically and that she \r had done well on her AP exam for her AB Calculus course.  When she \r heard the news that she had been waitlisted, she sent Harvard a letter \r explaining her independent reading project and listing everything she \r had read.  When her transcript scores came back—she received straight \r A’s and A-‘s on her finals and 5’s on her APs—Harvard finally let her \r know, in mid-July, that she had been accepted.  This could happen to \r you.</p><p>Believe me, I know the allure of a “senior slide.”  I know how much \r pressure there is to let loose and have fun.  Another counselor shared a \r story with me—by the way, we do not let this happen to IvyWise \r students!—about a student from a prestigious preparatory school who \r applied early decision to Duke.  He was accepted, although they were \r concerned about a B- he was getting in calculus.  They even warned \r him, telling him and his high school college counselor it was important \r that he do something about it.  But he didn’t listen.  In fact, he became \r cavalier after getting in and let his grade slide even further to a D.</p><p>Later \r that spring, Duke rescinded its offer of admission.  Needless to say, the \r student was devastated.  His parents were none too happy either.  Since \r he had not applied anywhere else, the student ended up taking the year \r off to work.  He retook calculus, got an A, reapplied to Duke, and got in.  \r This may sound harsh, but Duke knew what it was doing.  Anyone who \r would pull a stunt like that is clearly not mature enough to go to college.  \r A very humbling year later, the student finally took his first step onto the \r Duke campus, a bit older and a whole lot wise.  Again, all I can do is ask \r you to envision that same first step onto the campus of your dreams.  It is \r a moment of ultimate freedom.  You are finally an adult in the eyes of the \r world.

By looking for key words and phrases in their handouts, students can accurately interpret their college writing assignment.', '<p>It’s not even two weeks into the new semester, and it’s already happened; your professor has just assigned the dreaded research paper.  Even though it isn’t due for months, your diligent instructor has already passed out a three-page overview of the assignment and directed the class to choose a topic.</p><p>Rather than sitting on your hands and doing the minimum amount of work necessary to meet her deadlines, you’ve decided to get a jump start on your paper.  There’s just one problem: you have no idea what your professor is asking you to do!</p><p>Of course, it’s understood that she wants to see a ten-page report on her desk exactly one week before the final, but beyond that, you’re stumped.  What sort of sources do you need?  Does she want your opinion on the subject, or just the facts?  What to write about?!</p><p>Before you get too excited, take a deep breath and fish that assignment out of your backpack.  Most everything you need to know is in this document.  The rest you can either infer or hear straight from the horse’s mouth (the horse would be your professor, no disrespect intended!).</p><p>Requirements are often stated or implied in any handouts you receive on the paper.  Pay close attention to the language and wording in the handouts - this will help you understand your professor''s expectations.  The technical specifications are usually clearly spelled out - minimum and maximum length, margins, font style and size, spacing, etc.</p><p>You don''t need to worry about most of these minute details until later, though, so you can set them aside for now.  However, make a mental note of the minimum and maximum required length.  The length of the paper will help determine the scope of your topic - the shorter the paper, the more limited you must be in your discussion.</p><p>That’s not to suggest that you must choose a very narrow, highly specific topic right away.  Quite the contrary!  Your initial topic choice will be very broad in scope, and you’ll gradually whittle it down as you progress through the research process.  At this early point, you simply don’t know enough about your subject to describe it in detail.</p><p>In addition to the technical details, you will need to look beyond the clearly stated specifications so that you can identify the content that your professor is expecting from you.  This isn''t high school, so your professor will very rarely want just a summary, lacking in inquiry and devoid of any analysis.  Most likely, you will be asked to present an argument and support it with evidence.  Rather than regurgitating what you''ve read, you''ll be expected to digest the viewpoints of several different scholars and articulate your own analysis of the topic.</p><p>There are many different approaches you can take when writing a research paper, along with an infinite number of topical choices.  As such, you''ll need to look for keywords in your handouts to determine what type of approach your professor would like you to take, as well as clues as to appropriate topic selections:</p><p>* Does your professor single out any one individual, event, idea, or theory that your paper should address? [Keep an eye out for words or phrases that your class will study during the semester.]</p><p>* Does she offer a number of topics for you to choose from? [The words “and/or” are good indicators that your professor is offering more than one option.]</p><p>* Does your professor specifically ask for your personal viewpoint, or does she want a scholarly analysis of the facts? [Phrases such as “explain your position” and “what’s your opinion?” signify that she’d like you to editorialize a bit.]</p><p>What if your professor doesn’t offer any of the above clues?  Should you get a frustratingly vague assignment, don’t panic!  While it may prove more difficult to choose a topic, such an assignment also offers you the opportunity to flex your creative muscles and write about a subject that interests you!  Take a look at your textbook; pay special attention to the index and table of contents.  Browse around until you find an issue which appeals to you.  As long as it’s in your course’s text, it’s probably fair game for your paper.</p><p>Certainly, it is always a good idea to run the idea by your professor before getting too involved.  Students may be hesitant to meet with their professors, for fear that it makes them look “dumb” or “ignorant.”  Yet, professors generally welcome questions; they view them as a sign that you are involved in class and interested in the material.  So go ahead - pick a topic, schedule a meeting, and then hit the stacks!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Copyright Kelly Garbato, 2005</p><p>Kelly Garbato is an author, ePublisher, and small business owner.

Answer these 5 questions to find out if you are ready to take an online course!', '<p>Just a few short years ago, the idea of taking a college course through the Internet was something online “techies” considered.  Now that people realize how convenience it is to take a class without leaving home, more and more people are taking advantage of using their computer to learn.</p><p>But while the technology used for online classes is so simple just about anyone can become an online student, you should ask yourself the following 5 questions first – and save yourself a lot of stress!</p><p><b>1) Do you have the time?</b></p><p>Many people think – mistakenly – that online courses are “easier” than traditional campus classes.  But most online classes require regular participation.  So, you must have the time to “log on” to your course several times each week, complete the assignments and do your homework, and interact with the other students.</p><p>All of this takes time…and, you have to account for the time you would normally have spent in the classroom.  If you have the time, you will find taking an online class to be very convenient!</p><p><b>2) Do you have the discipline?</b></p><p>Sure, most online classes don’t require you to be on the computer at a specific time (although some do).  So it is up to you to make sure you check in on your class several times each week.  With a busy work schedule, sports, hobbies, housework, kids, it’s easy to put your class low on your priority list.  And that could mean big trouble when it comes time to get your grade.</p><p>It’s not the teacher’s job to remind you to keep up with your work – that’s your responsibility.   A simple way to make this work is to create your own schedule, so each week you know exactly when it’s time to “go to class”!</p><p><b>3) Do you have the money?</b></p><p>While there are many free or low-cost online “self help” courses available, college courses almost always cost the same whether you take them on-campus, or online.  Colleges have to buy the software, train their faculty, and offer student services after hours – so expecting online courses to be less expensive is not reasonable.</p><p>On the other hand, the same financial aid is often available for online classes, just as with campus classes.  So, money should not stop any student from furthering their education!</p><p><b>4) Do you have the right technical skills?</b></p><p>Fortunately, you don’t have to be a computer “genius” to take an online class.  The technology has become very simple for students and teachers to use, so that students who can “surf the Internet” and use email usually have the necessary technical skills.</p><p>Before getting started, the school offering the course should have a sample course, tutorial, or other training to help you determine if there are any skills you need to learn, so you can become a successful online student!</p><p><b>5) Do you have the right computer equipment?</b></p><p>Since most online classes are taught through the Internet, students usually don’t need any special computer equipment.  However, most online classes require students to have reliable access to the Internet, an email account (and the knowledge to use it), a word processor (such as Microsoft Word), and antivirus software.  Check with your school to see if there are any other requirements.</p><p>A high speed internet connection is usually not required, but if instructors use graphics, videos, audio lectures, or other big files, a high speed connection (such as DSL or cable) will help you open the files, and do you work, more efficiently!</p><p>Are you ready now to take your first online class?  Then it’s time to contact your local college, or search the internet for an online class directory, and see what online courses you can take!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Kris Bickell is the owner of Hi-Speed-Internet.com, a helpful site for consumers comparing high speed internet services.

This is evaluated as cheating as one is trying to take credit for someone else’s work. However taking references from someone else’s work and mentioning his/her name on each line copied as it is, is not part of plagiarism. It is called in text citation.</p><p>Plagiarism is becoming really common these days in assessments that students submit for their college work. This is considered as a serious offence as attempt like this undermines the value of college degrees. It has been until recently that the managements have decided to impose harsh penalties on students who are found guilty of plagiarism.</p><p>Ways to Combat Plagiarism</p><p>In order to avoid plagiarism, several universities and schools have started using anti plagiarism software’s and other electronic methods to detect plagiarism that can detect similarities and frequencies of words and phrases. In other schools the management also keeps track of the work previously submitted by students in order to ensure that the work is not copied from earlier years.</p><p>In order to avoid plagiarism students are nowadays made to sign statements in which they accept that the work they have submitted, is their own and the contribution from other sources has been properly acknowledged. Because that’s what being in a community is all about, learning together and cooperating such gestures make the students realize the importance of their acts and portray that the management is vigilant about their work and that plagiarism or e-cheating can get them into trouble.</p><p>The central point is that when one is producing a piece of work that would be evaluated, one must entirely cite his own work, written by him in his own words  and containing his own ideas, interpretations, approaches etc. in case the ideas and words have been copied from someone else then it should be stated clearly with proper reference. Precisely its easy for a person to avoid plagiarism, all what matters is that one should put his/her own effort into the material he submits for assignment. Students who deceive are more likely to become white collar criminal thus depriving the hard workers from achieving their goal.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Fighting plagiarism and e-cheating has become very essential in these times especially because text from all across the globe can be viewed through internet. People who fake someone else’s work as their own must be caught because with purloining someone’s hard work they may pass in their degrees and probably get jobs, but they will have difficulty once they enter into their professional lives. Secondly with vigilant software working to catch plagiarism, students with real aptitude will come out in the light and the carefree attitude towards studies could be warned against.</p><p>Bibliography</p><p>Zero Tolerance of Cheating and Plagarism.

Student loans don’t have to equate to student debt and if you plan your finances, it is possible to get by without student loans and possibly even profit from them.  There are many sites on the internet which provide downloadable student finance guides and online advice on how best to manage your finances.  Moneynet offers a comprehensive student finance guide whilst the money section on support4learning is also a popular internet resource.</p><p>The first step to avoid financial dependence on a student loan is to consider taking a gap year to gain experience and earn money.  This is a great opportunity to start saving for university and will give you funds to cover accommodation and bills without tapping into your student loan.</p><p>In terms of managing your personal finances, you could open up a notice savings account and invest your gap year earnings – alongside a student loan, accruing interest on the total amount, but being disciplined so that you only ever tuck into your savings – not the loan itself.</p><p>If you’re comfortable that you can timetable it – you might consider a part-time job to help finance your studies, using your income to cover the majority of your expenses so that you can leave your bank savings alone.  There will be times when you may have to make a withdrawal from your savings account, but if you leave the capital there as long as possible – the more money you will make.</p><p>If you’re concerned about getting the maximum amount of interest on your loan, you could try doing a savings comparison search on the internet.

The same holds true for traditional college degree programs.</p><p>So, just as when you are looking for an offline course, you need to do the same kind of your research when you are looking for the best place to pursue an online college education.</p><p>Of course, you normally won''t care where the college is located unless part of the online program involves off-line meetings.  Usually the physical location just doesn''t matter.  However, a lot of the other points that you would consider before attending a traditional offline college or university should also be considered before you enroll with any organization offering an online college education.</p><p>The growth in the numbers of people pursuing an online college education has led to increased competition among institutions to attract students. The best way to assess the credibility of a site advertising that they have the best online college education is to ask about the accreditation of its courses. Accreditation means that some governing body for a particular field has endorsed the course.  This can be extremely important in helping you to decide who to trust with your online college education. If a course is not accredited then you need to find out why.</p><p>There may be a number of courses that have not yet received accreditation from an appropriate association or governing body but still offer a good online college education. For example, the establishment may have applied for accreditation but not yet been assessed.  In that case you can actually check with the particular accrediting agency to be certain that they actually are in the process of assessing the application for accreditation. Another reason may be that there is no appropriate accrediting body for a course. This is less likely but, nevertheless, could be a valid reason and doesn''t necessarily  indicate that the course offered is not going to be worth taking to advance your online college education.</p><p>If, however, you find that the online college education institution has been refused accreditation, then they are likely to try to tell you that accreditation is not important. And that simply isn''t true. An online college education from a non-accredited institution is not going to be viewed as positively as one from an accredited establishment. Choose where you go to get your online college education with care to ensure that you are not wasting your time and money by having a nearly worthless qualification.</p><p>Another factor related to accreditation has to do with professions requiring some form of governmental license or certification.  You need to be certain that any college degree or other course certification will be acceptable to whatever licensing body has authority over the profession in the location you live and work in.  For example, a course which is accepted in one state, may not be accepted by the authorities in another state.</p><p>You need to think of the online college education arena as a marketplace. You are the consumer and as in any marketplace, you need to check the quality of the product and the ''merchant'' according to the circumstances that apply to you and your area of study. While this may seem like a lot of work at times, it is your future, your time and your money that are involved. So take a little extra time and verify the value of any online college program (or any type of online learning) that you are considering.</p><p>Copyright 2005 Richard Keir</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="72" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Richard-Keir_6223.jpg" border="0" alt="Richard Keir - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>As a writer and educator, both online and offline, Richard strongly supports the value of quality online educational programs in increasing access to education in today''s hectic world.

Nevertheless, it might be useful sometimes, to recall how these issues can be resolved in clear and transparent way.</p><p>Consider, for example the fight for the rights of the animals. In 1992 in Michigan there were attacks on the animal laboratory at Michigan State University. Another laboratory at the Washington State University suffered from the attacks as well. Some research offices were seriously damaged in the acts of arson in Utah. There were controversies, and these controversies exist now- despite the fact that more than fifteen years have passed, there is still a huge disagreement between those animals rights activists who claim that computer simulations are as good as animal research, and those scientists who insist that the researches on the animals are indispensable for the furtherance of their scientific work.</p><p>Undoubtedly, according to many scientists the animals are really indispensable for their research. After all they are used to help humans in their grapple against mortal and incurable diseases. For example pigs are used in the researches on diabetes and vascular diseases, dogs are used s, as steadfast and ones of the most reliable companions for people with disabilities; they play crucial, and sometimes vital role in the law enforcement agencies, other examples can be easily provided to support the assertions of scientists that animals can be used to assist people.  Yet, nevertheless, these facts can hardly convince animal activists.</p><p>Lorraine Hough office in 1992 took the role of leader in the fighting against growing public antipathy to the scientists who conducted the research on the animals. According to Gallup Poll 2 of 3 American teenagers supported the rights of the animals.  Hough was the director of The Texas Society for Biomedical Research.</p><p>Thus the society decided to launch bold and interesting experiment- it announced the essay contest for school children “ Why animals are important to Biomedical research.” Yet, despite the fact that the company provided financial incentive –more than $250 and $500 dollars in prizes, it was nevertheless difficult to find the participants.</p><p>Today this is an annual content in the Texas Society of Biomedical Research.

Obviously, new faculty, who tend to have a higher teaching load than do full professors, and who are often teaching classes that they have never taught before, probably spend more than 30 hours a week.  At some colleges with more of a teaching emphasis, it has been estimated that new professors may spend 50-60 hours a week on teaching.</p><p><b>What Can You Do To Lighten Your Teaching Burden?</b></p><p>Robert Boice, the author of Advice to New Faculty Members, devotes the first 100 pages of his book to teaching.  His advice can be boiled down to “moderation in all things.”  When it comes to teaching, there are specific actions you can take.  Here are some of his recommendations that I believe are the easiest to implement.</p><p>1. Don’t try to fit too much into each class</p><p>2. You don’t have to know everything</p><p>3. Simplify and make things more clear</p><p>4. Allow pauses during class</p><p>5. Do the “hardest work before it seems like work”</p><p><b>Don’t Try to Fit Too Much Into Each Class</b></p><p>Many new professors make the mistake of equating quantity with quality.  The truth is that it is easy to overwhelm and bore your students.  Do you want them walking out of your class with pages of poor notes, not having taken in most of what you’ve said?  Or do you want them to leave energized, excited, and clear about your most important points?</p><p><b>You Don’t Have to Know Everything</b></p><p>Students are relieved and, ironically, will like and trust you more if they find out that you’re NOT perfect.  Studies show that students prefer hearing their professors reason things out.  Showing the process of your thinking is excellent modeling. You don’t earn their respect by being the smartest, most knowledgeable person in the world.  You earn it by respecting them.  If you don’t know the answer to something, model a scholar’s attitude of curiosity.  Compliment them on the excellent question, say you’ll look into it and that you’ll answer it in the next class.</p><p><b>Simplify and Make Things More Clear</b></p><p>The information is often already in the assigned readings.  If classes function only as information dumps, students will be resentful.  On the other hand, if you can simplify, clarify and help them see the information in a new way, you will be making the class time valuable to them.  Do you notice how this interacts with the idea of not fitting too much into the class?  In order to clarify and simplify, you can’t complicate things by forcing too much information into their heads.</p><p><b>Allow Pauses During Class</b></p><p>Racing through the material will leave you and the class breathless.  It’s not only OK, it’s preferable to let there be some spaces where you collect your thoughts, find the next page of your notes, or ask if there are questions and allow a silence for students to digest the material.  These pauses will allow you to gauge audience reaction and shape your subsequent remarks accordingly.</p><p><b>Do “The Hardest Work Before it Seems Like Work”</b></p><p>I used quotes because this concept is directly from Boyce’s book.  As you go about your day, make notes of thoughts about future classes that crop up in your mind.  Expand on those during little breaks of a few minutes in your day, making mini-outlines or taking notes on further thoughts.  Continue to expand on these ideas, imagining student reactions, metaphors or examples you might use, questions you might ask, discussion points, etc.  Thus you are not preparing in one painful session, but slowly building to a preparation that will be partly complete.</p><p><b>My Recommendation</b></p><p>I suggest that you choose at least one of these ideas to try out in your teaching preparation or in your classes this week.  You might find the transition a little scary, but you also might find that it helps your teaching.  What have you got to lose?</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Gina J Hiatt, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist, tenure and dissertation coach who helps faculty and graduate students realize their dreams.

The number and of jobs available for college graduates is much greater and they often have higher salary and benefits.', '<p>A college degree is an advantage in today’s workforce. The number and of jobs available for college graduates is much greater and they often have higher salary and benefits.</p><p><b>Availability of Jobs</b></p><p>The number of jobs that require a college degree or where a college education is an advantage is increasing. In previous generations, there were many levels of jobs available for those without a college education or in some cases, even a high school diploma.  However now many of these jobs simply do not exist any longer, or now require college education.</p><p>Industrial jobs, trades and skilled labor were more prevalent before the rise of computer technology.  Now many industries require a smaller workforce because of technological advances.  Even though not as many assembly line workers are needed, there are many jobs available in engineering, management and business administration in which a college education is an advantage.</p><p><b>Types of Jobs</b></p><p>The advantages of a college degree in scientific, manufacturing and engineering fields are very strong.   College students can now study highly specialized science related degrees that apply directly to business settings.  Safety engineering, environmental science and DNA analytics are examples of highly specialized fields that have become in demand in just the past 10 years or so.</p><p>One of the advantages of a college education is that students become aware of many subjects and fields that they never would have considered without going to college.  Students are required to take a variety of basic education courses such as math, sciences, literature and basic computing.  Electives are also required and students may take a course that just sounds interesting or appealing to them.  Often students discover during one of these courses that they have a talent and/or passion for a subject and begin to understand its potential in the job marketplace.</p><p>While obtaining a specialized degree is necessary in some fields, sometimes just having a college education is an advantage, regardless of the field of study.  Employers want to know that their employees have a well rounded basic education.  The advantages of a college degree will be proven when your resume is chosen over those who did not make the commitment to complete their education.</p><p><b>Salary & Benefits</b></p><p>The advantage of a college degree equals to higher wages and salaries.  In the Winter 2004-05 Occupational Outlook Quarterly, The US Department of Labor reported that “In 2003, workers who had a bachelor’s degree had median weekly earnings of $900, compared with $554 a week for high school graduates—that’s a difference of $346 per week, or a 62 percent jump in median earnings.”  These figures are a bold statement that the advantage of a college degree is its increased earning power.</p><p>Job seekers will also find that positions that may not actually require a college education will still pay more to those who have a degree.  Jobs seekers with a college education will still earn higher salaries, even when the degree is not directly required for the job.</p><p>The jobs that do not require a college education often have fewer benefits.  These jobs often provide no retirement or health insurance benefits which are imperative to financial security and the stability of the family.</p><p><b>The Advantage of a College Degree: Conclusion</b></p><p>Attending and graduating from college is the best way to prepare for a career that pays well and provides a means to a secure future. If you are determined and hard working, you can complete your education and begin a career that will provide now and pave the way to a secure retirement.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Michael Carter is a contributor at CollegeFinancialAidGuide.com, an online informational resource for educational funding, scholarships and student loans.

However, there are many different types of search engines, some of which are more suitable for a student’s research needs.', '<p>The Internet consists of billions upon billions of individual files, located on millions of different web sites.  Certainly, then, the ‘Net is a veritable treasure trove of information for students, who routinely turn the Web for help with their coursework.  Yet, all this knowledge is of little use if you don’t know how to locate and access what you need, quickly and easily.  Enter search engines!</p><p>Search engines are essentially tools that allow you to search for information available on the Web using keywords and search terms.  Rather than searching the Web itself, however, you are actually searching the engine''s database of files.</p><p>Search engines are actually three separate tools in one. The spider is a program that “crawls” through the Web, moving from link to link, looking for new web pages.  Once it finds new sites or files, it adds them to the search engine''s index.  This index is a searchable database of all the information the spider has found on the Web.  Some engines index every word in each document, while others select certain words (such as those occurring most often).  The search engine itself is a piece of software that allows users to search the engine''s database.  Clearly, an engine''s search is only as good as the index it''s searching.</p><p>So, when you run a query using a search engine, you''re really only searching the engine''s index of what''s on the Web, as opposed to the entire Web.  No one search engine is capable of indexing everything on the Web - there''s just too much information out there!  Consequently, much of the information overlooked in search engine queries includes breaking news, documents, multimedia files, images, tables, and other data.  Collectively, these types of resources are referred to as the deep or invisible Web.  They''re buried deep in the Web and are invisible to search engines.</p><p>Search engines usually feature advertisements in the form of paid results.  Those sites that pay a fee may be included in your search results, usually at the very top of the list.  Some engines group advertisers separately, for instance, on the side of the page.  While search engines must clearly label all advertisers, they vary widely in their compliance with FTC rules.</p><p>The method by which an engine determines how its search results will be presented to the user is called ranking.  Early search engines, now called first generation search engines, used term ranking to organize their results.  In term ranking, a result''s importance is determined by how often and where the search term appears in the document.  Most of today''s search engines are much more sophisticated than this.  These second generation search engines use a number of methods, sometimes in combination, to rank their results.</p><p>In relevancy ranking, second generation engines use various algorithms to determine a document''s relevance to your search.  This is by far the most popular ranking method, though engines often allow you to sort your results alphabetically or group them by site, source, and/or concept.</p><p>In addition to ranking method, a number of other features distinguish one engine from another.  You will encounter two basic types of search engines.  Individual search engines are just that - individual engines which compile and search their own databases.  Meta search engines, on the other hand, search several individual search engines at once.  Meta engines do not maintain their own databases, but search those assembled by other engines.</p><p>Meta engines present their search results in one of two ways.  Using separate retrieval, they may group the results collected from each individual engine separately, so that you have a list of results from each engine.  Separate retrieval often results in many redundant “hits.”  Collated retrieval solves this problem by weeding out duplicate results obtained from different individual engines.  Many engines allow you to choose between the two or even use collated retrieval while still grouping your results by search engine source.</p><p>Search engines can be useful when conducting research, as long as you exercise caution.  Always keep an eye out for paid results, and try to avoid engines that don''t disclose their advertisers.  Search engines are a good idea when you have a very specific or obscure topic to research.  Queries for broad or popular topics will return more results than is practical, and the information found may be of questionable quality.  Thus, you should stick to academic databases unless you are having trouble finding enough information on your topic.  Search engines can also be helpful if you''re looking for specific types of files, such as pictures.</p><p>Meta engines are even more helpful in tackling those “needle in a haystack” searches, since they conduct several searches at once.  For this reason, they are also good if you want to get an overview of what is out there, or if your topic is an uncommon one.  Keep in mind, though, that meta searches will only retrieve the most relevant results from each engine, since they''re limited in the number of results they can uncover.  Another casualty of meta searches is flexibility.  Because you''re searching many engines at once, you''re only granted access to the search features that they all have in common.</p><p>Finally, you should not rely on any one engine.  Recall that each engine draws on a different database (or group of databases, as is the case with meta engines).  Some cover portions of the deep web, while others go nowhere near it.  Accordingly, you will get a different set of results depending on which engine you use.  Rather than become familiar with only one, try out a number of them and pick a dozen or so that you like.  While you should read each engine''s instructions before running a search, don''t try to memorize all the details, since they''re likely to change anyway!</p><p>Search engines are an excellent means of locating otherwise impossible-to-find information online.  There are many options available for the discriminating student researcher, so be selective and choose an engine that meets your unique needs!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Copyright Kelly Garbato, 2005</p><p>Kelly Garbato is an author, ePublisher, and small business owner.

But no one has to stay that way. Adopt these "Habits of Stress-Free Living" and become happier and healthier right now!</p><p>Habit # 0\r "Law of 21"</p><p>If you keep up with a new mindset and take action on it for 21 days in a row it will begin to become a habit. That''s right-if you exercise, read, get up a little early, take vitamins, drink water, etc. for 21 straight days, your body and mind will become so accustomed to that behavior it will begin to accept it as a natural habit. That is when relaxing can become as easy as breathing.</p><p>Habit # 1\r "Re-learn to Breath"</p><p>Somewhere along the path in the stress jungle of higher education, some students forget how to breathe properly. Most students don''t even realize that they generally take short, quick, shallow breaths until they are so low on air they gasp in an overflow of oxygen. Taking shallow breaths prevents your brain from getting all of the oxygen it requires, thus forcing it to work on minimal fuel until the inevitable gush of gasped air comes rushing through. \r To get your body and mind out of the stress jungle and back into balance, you must practice these four steps of quiet and focused deep breathing.</p><p>1) In a calm place close your eyes, push all the air in your lugs and out through your mouth. Then focus on fully inhaling through your nose, expanding your belly first and then filling your lungs completely, with your shoulders pushed back, and your chest pressed out.</p><p>2) As you come to the end of your inhale with your eyes still closed, pause for about three seconds and feel the fullness of the oxygen in your body.</p><p>3) Don''t "huff-out" the exhale! Gently exhale the air in your lungs through your mouth, which should be in a relaxed jaw "hoooooo" position in a controlled manor, and keep exhaling until you feel your stomach press all the way in and then gently open your eyes.</p><p>4) Repeat this process 3-4 times. If you feel light headed, stop. This deep-breathing technique will help you to regain your mind/body balance in most any stressful time or situation.</p><p>Habit # 2 \r "Life isn''t fair...so stop being surprised when it''s not"</p><p>It doesn''t matter how privileged, lucky or fortunate someone else may seem. Everyone pays their "worldly" dues in their own way. It may be hard at times to be able to see past the glairing physical, intellectual or economical advantages that some students possess. However, to keep your stress level down keep in mind that every seemingly "charmed" person whom you encounter will eventually have to pay up a lump some of "life dues." Nobody gets away clean! Life isn''t fair. Get over it.</p><p>Habit # 3 \r "Get off the radar"</p><p>Every so often, intentionally get off your "Life Radar" by leaving your cell phone, laptop computer, planner/PDA, book bag, watch, etc. in your room while you go to a park, see a movie alone, walk through a museum, visit a bookstore, or catch a sporting event by yourself. Also don''t tell anyone where you''re going or how long you''ll be gone. Just go and be by yourself with no distractions, no to-do lists and no time-limits. Leaving the radar for a while will rejuvenate you and allow you to re-connect with the big picture even if you don''t realize that you have lost your connection.</p><p>Habit # 4 \r "Choose your battles wisely"</p><p>Don''t fight the world. You''ll never win. You''ll never please or beat everyone. Take frustrating events as they come and then decide which ones are worth your precious time and energy. Realize that your time and energy are the most valuable assets that you own. Do you really want to give them away to just any jerk you encounter or any annoying occurrence that pops up? Don''t interpret letting a "battle" go without a fight as weakness. It is not weakness but rather strength. How truly strong and smart is the one who spends his time yelling and pushing against every force of life, just to eventually turn around and notice how incredibly far behind he''s fallen? Fallen to the person who simply walked past the battle to begin with. Let it go.</p><p>Habit # 5\r "Stop calling 911 on your life"</p><p>Your life isn''t an emergency. No matter how many responsibilities you have, or how many tasks you have left to do, if you were to die in your sleep tonight, life would go on without you for everyone else. You and your endeavors are not critical to anyone but you. So ease up on yourself. Remember the age-old advice that in 100 years there will be an entirely new set of people on this plant. So why care yourself to death about what you''re doing now? In a mere 100 years even the greatest achievements of today will just be second-hand information to a whole new crop of people.</p><p>Habit # 6\r "Choose kindness over self-righteousness"</p><p>You can spend your entire life insisting your opinion is the right one, but nobody will like you. The more you push your need to be right, is equal to the level of compassion other people won''t have for you. Your opinion on a given issue is simply one of many differing opinions. Your opinion on a given issue is not right, and it is not wrong…it''s simply yours. Just like everyone else''s opinion is neither right nor wrong. If you do not accept other people''s opinions along with yours, you will be unhappy, stressed-out and lonely!</p><p>Habit # 7\r "You don''t have to clean up someone else''s mess"</p><p>Learning to say "no" to other people''s problems is vital to reducing your stress. You don''t have to catch someone else''s ball of problems when they throw it at you. You have a life of your own with tasks and hardships to deal with. It is okay to help a friend with a problem; just be aware of when you''re making their problem, your problem. It is possible to aid someone without taking on the problem yourself. What good are two people with one problem? Wouldn''t it be better to have one person with a problem, and then someone else with a clear head who can lend some logical support?</p><p>Habit # 8\r "More is not better"</p><p>No matter how hard you work to acquire possessions, status and experiences, you will always have more than some, but not as much as others. It''s a race you will never win. If you truly want to be happy and stress-free, the secret is to have access to life''s extras, not own them. You''ll notice that once you begin to collect or acquire "extra things," you are now responsible for them; and with responsibly comes stress. So, the less "extras" you own, is equal to the fewer things you are responsible for, which is directly related to the level of stress in your life. TRANSLATION: The less "extras" you own, the more time, energy and resources you''ll have to enjoy more.</p><p>Habit # 9\r "It''s all right to ask for assistance"</p><p>Don''t beg for help! Instead, ask for assistance. You''ll notice that people are more receptive and willing to assist others who explain their situation and ask for assistance, verses those who scream, "I need," "Give me," or "Help me now!" Build a mental team of helpers who you can turn to for assistance in times of heavy stress. This team can be comprised of family members, friends who you have frequent contact with, friendly professors, and even an old high school coach, counselor or teacher whom you have a continuing relationship with.</p><p>Habit # 10\r "Give yourself 10 minutes"</p><p>Take ten minutes for yourself every day to keep your stress level down. During this time, do not focus or direct your thoughts to any one specific thing. Simply turn everything in the room off, lie down on the floor, close your eyes, remove your shoes and then stretch yourself out and make your body as long as possible. Concentrate only on quieting your mind. Imagine you are lying on a beautiful, warm beach. Now picture that the thoughts in your head are in the form of butterflies, and as they come to you, you just let them fly right by. Once you do this they will come at you faster and faster, but as you continue to let them fly by, the butterflies will begin slowing down rapidly. It''s also okay if you fall asleep. Just keep letting those butterflies fly right past you every time you "give yourself 10 minutes."</p><p>Habit # 11\r "Give gratitude and it will come back"</p><p>Have faith that when you give gratitude, compliments and express generously that it will come back to you in one way or another. Simply say thanks when nobody else does, give praise when no one seems to notice, or spend a little extra of your time or money with someone or something that really needs some special attention. Realize that spreading gratitude isn''t a give-and-take experience. All you do is give, and understand that your life is better and less stressful for it in many ways that you''ll probably never notice.</p><p>Habit # 12\r "Express yourself"</p><p>Once you get bogged down in obligations and stop finding time and ways to express yourself, that is when stress creeps in. No matter how busy you are, you must always leave time to be creative. Write poems, songs, books or articles; play sports or instruments; paint, sculpt, dance, sing. Whatever you do to express yourself and display your talents, never stop doing it. If you stop doing what you love to do you''ll be inviting double stress into your life. You''ll now have the stress of doing all your tasks, along with the stress of not being able to express yourself. Kill the double stress and make time to express yourself. You''ll be happier and more likely to complete your other tasks when you make time to do what you love to do.</p><p>Habit # 13\r "Get organized"</p><p>Disorganization is one of the leading causes of stress for college students. Organize your papers, assignments and schedule into one notebook, binder or planner. Have everything you need to complete all of your tasks in one neatly arranged place. Keep only what you absolutely need. Clutter equals stress, and it kills college careers! Throw it out. If it''s very important, someone else will have it for you to make a copy of. Take neat notes and keep all of the information for a particular class separate from all of your other school materials. Also, do most of your homework, papers, and studying in the same place. Find a quite, clean, distraction-free area and make it your organized concentration place.</p><p>Habit # 14\r "This too shall pass"</p><p>No matter how stressed-out you are at any given time, repeat to yourself, "This too shall pass." Just like any bad rain storm, blizzard, or tornado, your bad relationship break-ups, very hard exams or lengthy public speaking presentations will have a beginning, middle and end. No matter how bad or stressful a situation you''re in, it will pass and your life will be back to normal and even better very soon-because now you''ll have the knowledge and experience of enduring that stressful situation to aid you when the next unpleasant situation comes around.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Please visit: <a target="_new" href="http://www.collegelifesecrets.com">CollegeLifeSecrets.com</a> for all the details.

Instead, researchers must find and utilize “deep web” search engines, which function much like those engines that search the “surface web.”', '<p>The Internet is a treasure trove of knowledge, especially for students in search of immediate information gratification.  However, the ‘Net contains billions of files, and unless you know the exact URL of the one you want, you’re going to have to rely on search engines to help you unearth the info you need.</p><p>Search engines are tools that allow you to search for information available on the Web using keywords and search terms.  Rather than searching the Web itself, however, you are actually searching the engine''s database of files.</p><p>Search engines are actually three separate tools in one. The spider is a program that “crawls” through the Web, moving from link to link, looking for new web pages.  Once it finds new sites or files, they are added to the search engine''s index.  This index is a searchable database of all the information that the spider has found on the Web.  Some engines index every word in each document, while others select certain words.  The search engine itself is a piece of software that allows users to search the engine''s database.  Clearly, an engine''s search is only as good as the index it''s searching.</p><p>When you run a query using a search engine, you''re really only searching the engine''s index of what''s on the Web, as opposed to the entire Web.  No one search engine is capable of indexing everything on the Web - there''s just too much information out there!  Additionally, many spiders cannot or will not enter databases or index files.  Consequently, much of the information excluded in search engine queries includes breaking news, documents, multimedia files, images, tables, and other data.  Collectively, these types of resources are referred to as the deep or invisible Web.  They''re buried deep in the Web and are invisible to search engines.  While many search engines feature some areas of the deep web, most of these resources require special tools to unearth them.</p><p>Estimates vary, but the deep web is much larger than the surface web.  Approximately 500 more times information is located on the deep web as exists on the surface web.  This consists of multimedia files, including audio, video, and images; software; documents; dynamically changing content such as breaking news and job postings; and information that''s stored on databases, for example, phone book records, legal information, and business data.  Clearly, the deep web has something to offer almost any student researcher.</p><p>The easiest way to find information on the deep web is to use a specialized search engine.  Many search engines index a very small portion of the deep web; however, some engines target the deep web specifically.  If you need to find a piece of information that''s likely to be classified as part of the deep web, search engines that focus on such content are your best bet.</p><p>Like surface web engines, deep web search engines may also sell advertising in the form of paid listings.  They differ in their coverage of deep web content and offer dissimilar advanced search options.  Engines that search the deep web can be classified as first vs. second generation, individual vs. meta, and/or separate vs. collated retrieval, just as with surface web engines.  Thus, you''ll need to familiarize yourself with the options that are available and gradually add the best engines to your bag of research tricks.</p><p>Let''s look at two popular deep web search engines for an illustration:</p><p>1.   Complete Planet (www.completeplanet.com) is a free commercial search engine.  It acts as a gateway to other search services, providing links to over 70,000 search sites.  For easy browsing, the links are organized by subject into a “browse tree.”  You can also search their links by keyword, which will retrieve a relevance-ranked list of results.  While they do sell advertising, paid results are clearly labeled as such.</p><p>2.   Scirus (http://www.scirus.com/srsapp/), in contrast, is more limited in scope.  An academic engine, it does not sell advertising or feature paid listings.  Rather than trying to provide access to the entire deep web, it focuses on scientific content.  Users can search over 167 million scientific web pages, databases, and journals with Scirus.  Results can be sorted in several ways, including by relevance and source.  Scirus is provided free by Elsevier, a company that also markets databases to individuals and institutions.</p><p>Obviously, Scirus is a more scholarly search engine than Complete Planet, and thus is more appropriate for your academic research needs.  Well, assuming that you''re conducting research for a physics or psychology class, of course!  If literature''s your thing, perhaps you might want to try out another academic deep web engine, such as the Directory of Open Access Journals (http://www.doaj.org/) or the New York Public Library''s holdings (http://www.nypl.org/).</p><p>When doing research for a class, you need to be just as discriminating with deep web search engines as you are with other online tools.  Always look for an engine''s advertising policy, and consider where it gets its funding.  Look for non-profit engines that only index information from reputable sources.  Search engines with a filter are a plus; for example, Scirus''s engine discards non-scientific web sites and relies mainly on information from the top-level domains “.edu” and “.org”.</p><p>As with the rest of the Internet, the deep web can be an excellent resource - but only when used with caution!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Copyright Kelly Garbato, 2005</p><p>Kelly Garbato is an author, ePublisher, and small business owner.

But, somewhere between fifteen and high school graduation, you begin to discover this faraway land of “college”.</p><p>What does this opportunity “college” really mean for most of us?  It is the difference between a life and an existence.  You can stop today to look around, and take the time to notice the have’s and the have not’s.  The people, who have, also have a college degree. College graduates work in jobs that bring them satisfaction, not just their next meal.  They enjoy what they do each day and they look forward to innovation and progress.  Most of the time, they are a part of those things, they actually help to bring about change and make progress.</p><p>If you’ve never taken the time to ask yourself (as I’m sure most teens have not), begin to ask yourself questions about your basic likes and dislikes.  What things in your life bring interest to you?  Even the smallest things can tell you something about yourself.  College helps you to further define these basic interests and find the right niche for you.  The possibilities on the job market are endless and so are available College degrees.  There are degrees out there in things you don’t even realize exist, until you enter the great gates of the “undergraduate” world.</p><p>What you also don’t know, (and won’t) unless you enter the realm of continued education, is that there are others just like you.  The student population abounds with entering college freshmen who don’t have a clue as to what they want to do with their lives.  The point is not necessarily knowing what you want to do, but having the initiative to seek out the answers.  There are so many doctors, lawyers, teachers, and engineers that started out without any idea about their chosen path.  They did, however, have the desire to get on the path.</p><p>Now, I realize the first, and most often used excuse, is a lack of money for college expenses.  Bah humbug!  I know at forty, what I did not at 18:  there is money available, if you want to find money.  The big hold up here is not the lack of availability it’s the lack of available guidance counselors and adults to help these young people find the funding.  It would seem to me, that as a guidance counselor, you would make available all information about scholarships, grants, and student loans to any young person on campus.  But this is not so.  Visit any high school in this country, and for the majority of students, there is no help to be found.</p><p>College is the doorway to the imagined, but unproven.  It is the bridge between what we are and what we can be.  It is a testament to the age old adage, “If you can dream it, you can do it!”</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Frederic Madore is the founder of the <a target="_new" href="http://college-information-center.info">College</a> Information Center.

This might require a student to relocate, or the student might be limited in the classes he or she can register for due to job requirements or scheduling conflicts. Today, the advantages of technology afford students opportunities outside the brick walls of an institution of higher learning. Many students are now opting to earn their college degrees online. As the popularity of attending college online increases, more traditional colleges and Universities are joining the fast-growing group of online-only college and Universities in offering several different levels of college degrees over the internet, presenting students with broader educational options, as well as flexibility and convenience.</p><p>There are many advantages to seeking a college degree online. A student need not live locally to attend the college of his or her choosing. Attending classes and submitting coursework online eliminates the need for commuting or relocating. Convenience is another factor in earning a college degree online. A college may be able to offer more sections of certain courses, allowing students more choices as to when to attend classes. Night and weekend sections of courses are usually offered as well, which is ideal for the student that also works full time and/or cares for a family. The flexibility of online college is very attractive. Further, for those who are considering returning to school after several years, attending college online is a great way to ease into the routine of class work and projects again, and can reduce the pressure of feeling the need to fit in with younger students. In addition, who wouldn’t find it appealing to attend college from the comforts of home?</p><p>When considering going online to earn a college degree, there are a few options open to the prospective student. There are several online-only institutions that are fully accredited and offer many choices of degrees. Accreditation is an important factor to consider in choosing an online college. If you have previous college credits you would like to transfer, attending an accredited college will be necessary to do that. Also, accreditation is beneficial for having your degree recognized by employers and professional organizations. Online-only colleges offer the benefit of a cutting edge learning format technologically, as well as accelerated programs for those who are in a hurry to earn a college degree for professional advancement.</p><p>The type of college degree earned online ranges from Associate’s, Bachelor’s, Master’s, and PhD degrees. And the fields of study and degree programs available are extensive. No longer is online education just for web designers and computer programmers. Students may study Business, Social Sciences, Humanities, foreign languages, Mathematics, Human Resources, Fine Arts, and various Healthcare programs. These are but a few of the fields of study available to the online student.</p><p>If you are worried that you might not be able to afford to earn a college degree online, there are options available to you. Some employers might offer to pay a portion or even all tuition and fees toward an employee receiving a degree. Also, financial aid in the form of grants, loans, and even scholarships might be available to you. Check with the particular online program of interest to see what financial options are available, since some colleges might not offer financial aid to students who attend part-time.</p><p>You might be concerned that earning your college degree online won’t provide as enriching an experience as attending a traditional face-to-face college or University. Earning a college degree online can be an experience that is every bit as enriching, interpersonal, and dynamic as attending college the old-fashioned way. A big misconception is that online learning is impersonal. This isn’t the case at all. Programs offered online present the same opportunities for group work, independent study, and interpersonal communication as do traditional methods of learning. In fact, attending college online helps to facilitate the independent learning process, as well as developing time management skills. Attending college online takes just as much commitment as the old-fashioned way of going to school, and the potential career and personal benefits are just as great, if not greater. Going online to earn your college degree is a legitimate, convenient, and flexible way for you to advance you education, as well as your career and personal potential.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Learn the essential information for picking the right online degree course at <a target="_new" href="http://www.higher-education-online.com">Online College Degree</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

And frankly, it isn’t easy trying to explain to students (and their parents) one very basic fact of the college admissions process:  You don’t choose the college. The college chooses you.</p><p>Here is a very simple way you can look at this complicated process.</p><p>You and a crowd of high school graduates are standing on one side of a big field. Each one of you desperately wants to go to a good college. On the other side of the field are all the colleges and universities that exist in the country.  After assessing your qualifications (merit), you send applications to all of the schools that you wish to attend.  The admissions officer at those schools sends you a letter of acceptance or rejection. Out of your acceptances, you pick one college and walk across that field and through the doors of that particular institution. For different reasons, different students will go to different colleges and some will not go at all.</p><p>Did you make the choice or did someone make it for you?  Usually, the college makes the choice for you. You get to choose from those schools that actually choose you.  For the most part, the people who work in college admissions are gatekeepers. They can accept or reject your application at will. If necessary, they can come up with some pretty convincing evidence to support their decisions: high or low entrance exam scores, excellent or poor grades, outstanding or terrible writing samples, or an abundance or lack of extracurricular activities.</p><p>Based on such criteria, it seems as if everybody in that big open field is getting a fair shot based on merit.  But this only disguises some of the built in advantages that go to you if you are a student who has the “right” background. The reality is that most students just don’t have the “right” background.  Supposedly, the good news about higher education is that it is egalitarian. Regardless of your background, there is a college on the other side of that field that fits you--all the way from the community college with its open door admissions policy to the elite university with its not-so-open door admissions policy.  It seems as if that great tracking system you thought you escaped in high school tracks you right into college and your place in society.</p><p>So are you going to choose or be chosen?  With very few exceptions, most of you will be chosen. It hurts me to say that because it suggests that there is something terribly twisted about our entire educational system.  Maybe, it is.   Maybe, it isn’t. Until the verdict comes in, here’s what I suggest you do:</p><p>Suggestion #1</p><p>Know that the college admissions process is a game mostly decided by people who must make assumptions about you, your abilities, and your potential.</p><p>Suggestion #2</p><p>Know that most colleges cannot afford to be overly selective or they’d go out of business.</p><p>Suggestion #3</p><p>Know that your determination and your ideas can lead you to success, in spite of your background.</p><p>Suggestion #4</p><p>Know that going to an elite college doesn’t necessarily mean you will get a good education and a high-status career.</p><p>Suggestion #5</p><p>Know that going to a community college doesn’t necessarily mean you will get a bad education and a dead-end job.</p><p>Suggestion #6</p><p>Know that you are always much more than where you go to college and the amount of tuition you are able to pay.</p><p>Suggestion #7</p><p>Not only should you know this…you have to believe it.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>J.K.

Whatever reason that you may have for not making it into the university is one thing.  But, now that there are so many options in getting into an online university you have little excuse to get your degree.</p><p>If you are thinking that there are no real benefits to doing this, you are sadly mistaken.  Here are some reasons that you should consider an online university for your education:</p><p>• First of all, convenience is at the top of the list.  Courses in the online university are designed to allow you the ability to go to school when you have the time.  Think this is too hard to manage?  Choose the courses that you need, take them when you have time, and stay at home while you are doing it.<br>\r • In fact, you can even learn while you keep up with life. If you have to work, if you have to take care of a family, or perhaps you just do not like that atmosphere of day to day college living, the online university is perfect for you.  In fact, it is great for those looking for a promotion if only they had some additional education in the field.<br>\r • Often times the online university will be far less expensive then a standard form simply because you do not have to pay for the vast amounts of time you spend on campus.  No room and board here.</p><p>The online university is best suited for the individual who can work well on their own.  It is offered to many people and it offers many various types of programs from elementary education through the master’s degree and beyond.  The online university is set up so that you succeed!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>for more information please see <a target="_new" href="http://www.online-university-advice.co.uk">http://www.online-university-advice.co.uk</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

The regimes established under Hitler and Stalin were incredibly similar with respect to the rise and control of the state.', '<p>Why is it that Germany''s fascism lasted a relatively short time compared to Russia''s communism? The regimes established under Hitler and Stalin were incredibly similar with respect to the rise and control of the state. Both systems were based on entirely different ideology and goals. Hitler''s Mein Kampf established the superiority of the German race and the need to expand as wanted by God. Hitler wanted the world. The government in Russia established by Lenin was based on a book called Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx, a call to the proletariate to unite and rebel against their selfish employers. It is my belief that Lenin had entirely good reasons for doing as he did, and felt he was helping the world as apposed to Adolf Hitler. Immediately after Lenin''s death, a man very much the same in nature as Hitler, Stalin, came to control the Bolsheviks and throw Russia in a civil war in a quest for power. You now have two men of equal aspirations soon to be in control of two very similar governments.</p><p>In any rise of power, there needs to be a period of careful planning requiring much thought. These two men had very little history with which to work with which to model their revolutions. Times had been changing rapidly, technological improvements in the fields of manufacturing, transportation, and communication made this period of time very different from any other. Hitler spent his time imprison writing his book, Mein Kampf, filling it full of warped ideas of conquest and superiority of one race over another. I think it is strange that such works would go unnoticed with nobody left to watch a man with such dangerous ideas. Lenin planned his revolution while in exile in Switzerland. Then he made a deal with the German government whereby he was hid on a train and passed through enemy Germany to Russia. The conclusions with respect to methods of acquiring power and controlling it when they did get it were very much the same.</p><p>Both rulers had full run of their respective governments. Stalin was already dictator of Russia with his power and loyalty of the people guaranteed by the secret police, the Cheka. This entity provided Stalin with an easy means of destroying the opposition and weeding out the undesirable to be sent to prison camps in Siberia, a virtual death sentence. For Hitler to ascend to that level of power he rammed the Enabling Act through the German Congress which gave him the power to enact laws. Under Article 1 of his new power, Hitler decreed the only existing party shall be the NSDAP. With Article 2 he declared all association of, collaboration with, and support of other parties would result in imprisonment in camps similar to Russia''s labor camps. With Hitler''s Gestapo, secret police, he enforced those rules and used existing policies to get rid of other unfit Germans. Political prisoners, homosexuals, Jews and other people sent to the concentration camps were given different colored symbols for easy identification. At this point, no one dared speak against their country even in the privacy of one''s home lest their children let something slip at school.</p><p>If you control people''s thoughts, you control them. Propaganda was an important tool used by both Germany and Russia. Hitler appointed a man by the name of Joseph Goebbles to head the Ministry of Public Enlightenment in Germany. This man used newspapers, magazines, and radio to spread Nazism. Even if a man bathed in thoughts of discontent at home, he was bombarded with propaganda in public, and at the workplace. Banners hung from building, posters on almost every sign or lamppost. Anyone with a suspicious look on their face was first detained, and the sent to a prison camp. It was no longer just desirable to be a Nazi considering the benefits like government contracts or being able to stand first in line, but necessary for employment. Russia employed much the same tactics with much more emphasis on fear.</p><p>Education was virtually unheard of in the early years of Russia, but by 1933 children were guaranteed primary education. Huge problems resulted form the ignorance and illiteracy, workers usually did not intentionally break machines but did not know how to use them. In official reports the reason for failure was terrorism by the Kulaks, rich peasants persecuted in the same way Germany''s Jews. German education was geared toward physical aspects and the fathering of children. Membership to the German Youth for boys was compulsory by 1936. Emphasis was placed on physical fitness and team sports in these youth groups. Outstanding youths went to Adolf Hitler schools for secondary education, and Order Castles for future party leaders.</p><p>Control of the economy and war time planning was a must for both nations. A story likened to the fact that with Communism you must give your cows to the government and they give you milk back. With fascism, you got to keep your cows and gave the milk to the government. Both systems were command economies and state controlled. Contingency plans were constantly drawn up and updated to fit new circumstances. Both nations were preparing for war. Germany was going to rule the world, Russia only wanted to defend herself from Capitalism.</p><p>The resulting governments evolving from the two different systems of thought were very similar. But as one can see, the aspirations were radically different. Hitler was a threat to everyone and needed to be dealt with. Russia kept to themselves and bothered no one. A Cold War ensued with Russia complete with the irrational fear of Communism, McCarthyism, and a peace time build up of weapons followed. Germany was crushed in battle and Russia''s Iron Curtain is being pulled down as I write.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>You may visit <a target="_new" href="http://www.TermPaperAdvisor.com">http://www.TermPaperAdvisor.com</a> and <a target="_new" href="http://www.TermPapersMadeEasy.com">http://www.TermPapersMadeEasy.com</a> for instant access to thousands of term papers.

Get the facts about the NCLEX exam!', '<p>To ensure public protection, the United States and its territories require entry into the practice of nursing to be regulated by licensing authorities within each jurisdiction. Each jurisdiction requires all candidates for licensure as entry-level nurses to pass an examination which assesses the knowledge required to perform safely and effectively. NCLEX stands for The National Council Licensure Examination which is a standardized exam used by each state board of nursing to determine if RN or LPN/LVN candidates are competent for entry-level nursing practice.</p><p>There are two NCLEX tests offered by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN): the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses - NCLEX-RN ® and the National Council Licensure Examination for Practical Nurses - NCLEX-PN ® . The NCLEX-RN is for registered nurse candidates while the NCLEX-PN is for practical and vocational nurses. The main difference between the two tests is the number and difficulty of correctly answered questions required to pass the exam. The States and territorial boards of nursing use these exams in making licensure decisions.</p><p>The NCLEX-RN has 265 questions and the minimum number you need to answer is 75. The NCLEX-PN has 205 questions and the minimum number you need to answer is 85. Both tests require an understanding of nursing practice and cover the following categories of client needs:</p><p><ul></p><p><li>      Safe, Effective Care Environment </li></p><p><ul></p><p><li>        Management of Care </li></p><p><li>        Safety and Infection Control </li></p><p></ul></p><p><li>      Health Promotion and Maintenance </li></p><p><ul></p><p><li>        Growth and Development Through the Life Span </li></p><p><li>        Prevention and Early Detection of Disease </li></p><p></ul></p><p><li>      Psychosocial Integrity </li></p><p><ul></p><p><li>        Coping and Adaptation </li></p><p><li>        Psychosocial Adaptation </li></p><p></ul></p><p><li>      Physiological Integrity </li></p><p><ul></p><p><li>        Basic Care and Comfort </li></p><p><li>        Pharmacological and Parenteral Therapies </li></p><p><li>        Reduction of Risk Potential </li></p><p><li>        Physiological Adaptation </li></p><p></ul></p><p></ul>\r The NCLEX exams are administered using Computerized Adaptive Testing – CAT. There is a six hour limit for NCLEX-RN and a five hour time limit for NCLEX-PN which includes time for the computer tutorial and breaks.</p><p>Using this method (CAT) each exam is unique and the questions are retrieved from a database as the exam progresses. The computer measures the ability of the candidate using the answers provided previously and changes the difficulty and topic of the new questions accordingly - if you answer correctly the computer will select harder questions and if you are answer incorrectly it will choose easier questions. The software estimates your ability every time you provide the answer to a question and with each new answer you provide the estimate of your ability gets more precise.</p><p>The exam software selects questions that it believes you will have a close to 50% chance of answering correctly – not too hard or too easy for the ability it believes you have. This is done so that a well prepared candidate will be asked more difficult questions thus having a good chance of passing the exam by answering the minimum number of questions while less prepared candidates are not forced to guess the answers to questions too difficult for them. The expected number of correct answers is half the total number of questions you are presented with because of the adaptive nature of the test.</p><p>After you answer the minimum number of questions for the exam the software will analyze your performance and it may shut-down the computer. This means that you either passed or failed the exam. The computer will shut-down only when the program running the test has determined with 95% certainty that your ability is either above or below the passing standard.</p><p>The only way to get additional questions is if you are very close to the passing score – either 2.5% above or 2.5% below it. If this is the case you should not worry about failing but instead should concentrate on answering correctly the next set of questions. You must understand that you are very close to passing the exam if you answer most questions correctly from this point on. You must answer the maximum number of questions on the exam only if at the end of each set of questions you are within the 2.5% above or below the passing score. The time you spend on each question is not an important factor with regard to passing but you should answer the required number of questions in the allotted time.</p><p>If you are required to answer the maximum number of questions and the computer still isn''t 95% sure you can pass, the 95% confidence requirement is dropped. If at this point you have a score higher than the minimum required you pass the exam otherwise you fail. If you run out of time and did not answer the minimum number of questions required you fail automatically. If you run out of time but you answered the minimum number of questions required and for the last 60 questions your score was never below the passing standard you pass otherwise you fail the exam. This does not mean that you have to answer the last 60 questions correctly but only that at any point during the last 60 questions your score was above the minimum required to pass the exam. You can think about it this way: for each correct answer add one to your score while for each incorrect answer subtract one. Adding your scores one at a time for each question answered should never result in a negative score in order for you to pass if you run out of time but you have answered the minimum number of questions required.</p><p>The NCLEX-RN and NCLEX-PN questions are mostly multiple-choice questions with four answers. In some cases the NCLEX exam uses more difficult question formats such as multiple-choice questions that require you to select one or more correct answers, fill-in-the-blank questions or questions that require you to identify an area on a picture. Both exams cover mostly the same topics but the NCLEX-RN is more difficult.</p><p>You must apply to your state board of nursing in order to take the NCLEX examination. That board of nursing will decide whether or not you are eligible for the NCLEX examination. If you are eligible you must register to take the exam using the Authorization to Take the Test (ATT) provided by the board of nursing in your state. They will also provide you with a list of testing centers and instructions for how to schedule and take the licensure examination.</p><p>Here are a couple of things you might want to consider if you are taking the NCLEX exam:</p><p><ul></p><p><li>attend an NCLEX review class to refresh your knowledge</li></p><p><li>always read and understand the entire question before answering it</li></p><p><li>answer and understand 3000 - 4000 practice questions</li></p><p><li>you can''t change an answer once you moved to another question so forget about it – good or bad what it is done is done so it is better to concentrate on the current question instead of pondering if you were right or wrong </li></p><p><li>always pick the answer you believe is best – the test is not designed to trick you but good reading and comprehension skill are required</li></p><p><li>always think about the safety of the patient when answering the NCLEX questions </li></p><p></ul></p><p>After you take the test you will have to wait for the results. The time you need to wait depends on how the results are reported in your state: mail, online, phone or email. If you fail the test you will receive a summary of your test performance indicating topics where you did well and topics that you need to study further. You will be able to take the test again after a mandatory waiting period (usually 45 days) which may vary from state to state.\r <strong>Good luck!</strong></p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>This article provided by <a target="_new" href="http://www.alabama-nursing-schools.com/NCLEX.htm">Alabama-Nursing-Schools.com</a>.

Here are a few tips and techniques that can cure up this plight if taken and followed seriously.</p><p>The biggest question mark after getting the research question is, “So! What am I supposed to do now?” Everything from books to the internet is available, but you can’t get yourself started. Why? Because, you don’t know how to start. What to take and what to leave?</p><p>Remember! Before initiating any written project it is necessary to decide the “angle of attack”. It means the perspective that you are going to follow while tackling your assignment. Once decided, evaluate its relevancy related to your thesis statement or research question. Satisfied with that, consider half work done.</p><p>The next step involves collection of information related to the assignment.  With this, the next thing that comes to mind is “search engine” and “library books”. But few people come with real related material. Mostly what we come up with is unnecessary junk that is just to be deleted later. To avoid waste of time instead just follow the bottom line:</p><p>“GET ONE PERSPECTIVE OF YOUR RESEARCH STATEMENT AND FOLLOW THAT”</p><p>But then it strikes that you will be left with only a little material by the end. Well this is not true. Because as you build up a specific standpoint and organize yourself to work on that, the fine points and details start pouring themselves.</p><p>Enhance your thinking potential by using logical principals, but once you are on your way then make yourself free. That is think and generate with passion because when you are building up a format then working with logical thinking hampers the productivity hence results are not achieved to their fullest .Don’t set up goals, just give a free flow and let your imagination take the toll.</p><p>But once you are done with the thinking process and have settled on a vague outline then you should come to the systematic logical thinking. For assembling your project effectively:</p><p>Start with an exact definition and brief description</p><p>Build the frame of your assignment on the content available with you</p><p>Be innovative and put down your approach in the text</p><p>Be like an educator and explore different aspects</p><p>Be bold to decide what you want to put and cut</p><p>Never bother yourself with the start, middle and end structure. Organization and editing is the last step. Be sure to store every idea and thought to arrange it in your work later.</p><p>During your job, you will be struck with your own convention. Mostly people discard it and continue with what they have with them beforehand. That’s the biggest mistake one makes. Remember! Your teacher wants the answer from you. So whatever you come up with is highly appreciated as long as you have got enough logic and rational background to support it.

It can be much simpler than going to an actual physical college, and often it’s the only way some people can fit a degree into their busy schedules. But is it worth it financially to get an online degree?</p><p>One of the big problems you’ll run into is respect for the degree. A good general rule is that for advanced degrees (an MBA, a master’s degree, or a law degree, for example) you shouldn’t even consider an online school. No one in a professional field is going to take it seriously, simply because there is a vast difference in quality between the regular graduate schools and an online one. However, for a college diploma, it’s not true to that extent – there are many good online schools, and they aren’t much different in quality from a local community college, where a large number of people get their degrees (or at least start off). You do need to watch out for online "diploma mills." If the place you’re planning on taking classes from is unestablished or is shady in any way, you shouldn’t get one from there. This is going to be on your resume for some time, and if it comes out that they are simply granting degrees for cash or other practices, your degree will be worthless. Avoid places that offer things like "life experience" credits for most of your requirements – that’s a sure sign that they aren’t really making you do the work for a degree. Bigger companies will know all about the "fake" degree programs, and a smaller one can find out with a simple google search. Because online degrees don’t cost that much, a college diploma can be worth it – it’s really a symbolic thing, that you were willing to do the work, and it will get you over a hurdle to your career advancement.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Teve Torbes is an awesome owner of a <A target="_new"HREF="http://www.fleascontrol.com">flea control</A> site, who knows a whole lot about <A target="_new"HREF="http://www.airmattressinfo.com">air mattress</A> stuff.

However, students need to know the different between academic and commercial subject directories, as well as how the type of directory they choose will influence their research results.', '<p>Students increasingly turn to the Internet to help them with their coursework.  Subject directories can be especially useful, whether you are in search of a movie review or a biography of Galileo.  However, subject directories - like many online tools - can sometimes blur the distinction between information and advertisements.</p><p>Subject directories are collections of links to web sites, categorized into different subject areas.  Human volunteers or employees can perform this task, or it might be automated by way of computer programs.  Subject directories may be made by anyone, but there are two main types of directories.</p><p>Academic or professional subject directories are created and maintained by experts, for other experts.  In contrast, commercial subject directories are geared towards the general public and are meant to generate revenue.  Such directories make a profit by attracting as many visitors as possible so that they can sell advertising on their sites.  Advertisements can be obvious or more subtle, ranging from a banner at the top of the page to paid listings within the subject directory itself.</p><p>Paid listings in commercial subject directories create an obvious problem.  While it''s understandable that the site''s creators are in business and need to generate income somehow, the general public isn''t aware of such practices.  Thus, many people assume that the information contained in all subject directories is selected for quality and relevance.</p><p>On the contrary, commercial directories rarely screen link submissions for quality, and questionable links may be included if their owners are willing to pay for placement.  Although the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has standards that subject directories must follow for disclosing paid listings, not all sites are up to snuff.  You will find the same conflict with many search engines, which also sell advertising space in the form of paid listings.</p><p>Subject directories are most useful in the early stages of the research process, when you''re trying to come up with a general topic idea, or if you need to narrow a broad idea down a bit. Using what Reva Basch (in “Researching Online for Dummies,” 1998) calls the “drill-down approach,” you can take a very broad subject heading and, step by step, break it down into smaller parts until you have a narrow, manageable topic to work with.</p><p>For example, let''s say you need to write a paper for your American History class, but you''re plum out of topic ideas.  No problem!  Using a subject directory, you could start with the broad subject of “History.”  Under this heading is a list of countries; since you''re taking an American history course, you''d choose the “United States.”  Under the US, you might find a list of time periods to choose from; if you know which period you''re most interested in, you''d make a beeline for that heading and explore the possible topics.  If not, you might browse each time period until you find a topic that sounds intriguing.  Using this approach, you''re sure to find something to write about!</p><p>Subject directories can also be useful if you already have a topic in mind.  Simply find your topic in the directory, either by clicking through the directory until you locate it or by conducting a search with a search engine (which many directories are equipped with).  Once you have located your topic, you will have a short list of highly relevant resources to help guide your research.</p><p>It''s best to use subject directories early on, when you''re conducting preliminary research.  If you have problems defining a topic, subject directories are most helpful.  With directories, you don''t have to formulate search queries, which require that you have a rather specific idea of what you''re researching.  Instead, you navigate around until you find an interesting topic, which the directory defines for you.  Subject directories can also be helpful if you need to locate some high-quality, peer-reviewed resources rather quickly, without having to wade through all the results a search engine would give you.  Your best bet is to look to subject directories if your topic is fairly current (but old enough that it''s no longer “breaking news”), and has received a good deal of coverage.  Obscure and out-of-date subjects are less likely to be included in directories.</p><p>When using subject directories for academic research, it''s wise to rely primarily on academic or professional directories.  Not only are they unlikely to contain paid listings (and, in the rare instances that they do, the paid listings are clearly labeled), but the links are carefully chosen by qualified experts in the field.  As a result, you have a better chance of actually finding your subject covered in academic directories.  You can also rest assured that any links included lead to reputable resources that are suitable for your needs.</p><p>If you do decide to look at commercial directories, try to find ones that disclose their listing policies and clearly label paid listings as such.  By all means, critically evaluate all the information you find online, and apply more stringent standards to commercial directories, search engines, and web sites.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Copyright Kelly Garbato, 2005</p><p>Kelly Garbato is an author, ePublisher, and small business owner.

It has more than 17,000 instructors and 240,000 students, out of whom roughly half are enrolled in its highly evolved online educational programs. It has 170 physical campuses spread over the US, Mexico, Puerto Rico and  ---. Since 1976, more than 171,600 working professionals have earned their degree from University of Phoenix.</p><p>The University of Phoenix is designed very differently from conventional universities. Its programs are aimed at working adults – AT&T, Boeing, IBM, Intel, Lockheed Martin, and Motorola -- not to mention the U.S. military.---who want to better their salaries by enhancing their qualifications. About 60% of students receive some tuition reimbursement from their employers, which include such blue</p><p>The School offers undergraduate and graduate-degree programs in Business, Business and MBA, Criminal Justice, Education and Teaching, Healthcare and Nursing, Human Services Information, Technology, Accounting, Management, baccalaureate nursing programs marketing, and the like,</p><p>~~~ Pros ~~~</p><p>1. You can enroll in on-campus, offline or Flexnet programs (the latter is a combination of the first two)\r 2. If you are a working adult, you will not feel out of place age wise:  the average student is 34 years old and earns between $50,000 and $60,000 a year\r 3. Again, if you are working, there is a high chance you can receive tuition reimbursement from your employer (60% of students do)\r 4. The tuition is much less than several other universities’.

Why is the UK such a popular choice for so many overseas students?', '<p>Can a quarter-million of the world’s brightest students be wrong? That’s one estimate of the number of foreign students who forsake the comforts of home and brave the UK’s food and, for many, forbidding weather to get the postgraduate education they consider the key to a bright future in their homelands.</p><p>The British Council puts the total number of overseas students currently studying in Britain – at all academic levels – at nearly one million, with two-fifths of post-graduate students hailing from other countries. The British government’s increasing recognition of the value of this phenomenon to the British economy overall is likely to increase its efforts to attract these students away from competing institutions in other countries and to address the complex student-visa laws that most overseas students cite as the greatest – and often the only – disincentive to seeking graduate degrees in the UK.</p><p>Studying in the UK, rather than at comparable universities and colleges in other countries, clearly remains the first choice of the largest segment of the overseas student population.</p><p>The principle reason can be summed up in the single word the 23-year-old Uzbekistanian Tulkin Sultanov gave the BBC as his reason for pursuing advanced studies in the UK: “reputation.” Worldwide, UK universities are renowned for their high academic standards, cutting-edge educational facilities (particularly in the sciences, engineering and the arts), and broad range of offerings combined with the flexibility to accommodate individual student needs.</p><p>Like many other students who eventually go to the UK itself, Sultanov was educated in a British school in his homeland. As a result, he said, he knew both that British teaching was high-quality, that the professors at British universities had international reputations as leaders in their fields – and, crucially, that alumni of British universities enjoyed a level of professional success on return to their homeland that made them the envy of their generation.</p><p>UK universities and colleges are continuously evaluated by professional bodies to ensure that their teaching and research standards and their facilities are at the highest standards. The result has been the more important rating by the rest of the world, which at this point assumes that any British post-graduate education is top rank. Because standards are now known to be high at all levels, an unrivaled prestige attaches to a master’s or doctoral degree earned at a British university.</p><p>Of the half-million Chinese students studying abroad annually, some 50,000 have chose the UK as their academic destination of choice, together spending an estimated £550m a year on their UK educations. Twenty-two-year-old Lin Disheng, a Chinese student featured in another BBC story, followed his BS degree from Nottingham University (where he earned first-class honors in e-commerce and digital business) with a master’s degree programme at Oxford. Citing China’s rapid industrialisation and economic growth, he told the BBC, “Chinese young people like me want to make a contribution to this rapid process. That''s why I want to study In the UK - to learn better western technologies and experience the western culture and do the best I can.”</p><p>It goes without saying that the students who are accepted into British universities are the top students of their home countries’ top universities. Still, for most, what amplifies the education they received at home can be summed up in the three words independence, creativity and self-reliance. These are not only qualities they pick up at the personal level – although the mere process of adapting to, and then succeeding in, a culture often significantly unlike their own gives them a level of self-confidence they might well not even need in their homelands.</p><p>More to the point, a UK graduate education teaches foreign students a kind of independent thinking, creativity with ideas (most conspicuous in artistic disciplines but as evident in disciplines such as business and politics – “thinking outside the box” – and even science. Most foreign student have come from academic environments that have emphasized rote learning and, with the best of intentions, the dutiful regurgitation to their professors of the teachers’ own ideas. Only in an environment that both fosters and teachers ways of independent thinking do students learn how to generate their own ideas, propose and test original solutions to problems, and trust their own creative impulses.</p><p>British universities also offer well-recognised value for money. Undergraduate degree programmes, for example, are typically spread over three rather than four years, and most master’s degree programmes are designed to be completed in one year. This makes them highly cost-effective when compared to the longer time it takes to complete comparable courses of study in other countries, particularly in the US. Also, scholarships and other forms of financial aid make it possible to for many foreign students to enter institutions they would not be able to attend on their own or their families’ resources. Personal support in gaining access to such assistance, overseen by highly trained university administration staffs, helps many foreign students navigate that thicket of qualifications that sometimes discourage them from pursuing this vital source of financial help.</p><p>Furthermore, access to government-funded health care contributes greatly to the financial advantages of studying in the UK. Students in any full-time course in Scotland and in full-time courses lasting at least six months in England, Wales or Northern Ireland are entitled to free medical treatment from the British National Health Service.</p><p>Another advantage of study in the UK is that some students can, if they must or wish, work while they are pursuing their degrees. Because they are from outside the EU, students who are registered is a course of study longer than six months can work as much as 20 hours a week during term time and full-time during holidays. Students who need to supplement their finances to live as well as study abroad will be happy to know that part-time work is easy to find. Others may find working part-time a valuable way of learning more about the local culture outside the confines of academe.</p><p>The UK also offers a unique variety of graduate academic settings. In addition to the universities and colleges ensconced within Britain’s bustling, dynamic cities – which include far more places than London, though the capital is unrivaled for its academic, cultural, and other offerings – students can choose to study on purpose-built countryside campuses, often in areas of singular natural beauty as well. While some foreign students understandably want the programmes as well as the prestige of Britain’s famous, time-honored seats of higher education, others prefer the more modern, state-of-the-art universities that have sprung up throughout the country, sometimes with specific academic specialisations, sometimes offering a full range of post-graduate programmes.</p><p>Indeed, exposure to the larger culture is, though often overlooked during considerations of where to study abroad, one of the strongest reasons for choosing the UK as a place to pursue an advanced degree. Exploring the country beyond the university campus is sure to strengthen English skills and, more to the point, it does not require learning yet another language beyond the international language of English that has become the worldwide academic norm.</p><p>In addition to the native, local, and popular cultures, Britain offers some of the richest examples of Western culture to be found anywhere in Europe – and not just in London. Although London plays second fiddle to no other city in Europe in terms of its cultural offerings of all kinds, there are also significant cultural centres and events in other UK cities, such as Birmingham, which has one of the world’s greatest symphony orchestras, and Edinburgh, a city with an extraordinarily rich year-around cultural life and a summer festival of all the arts that is one of the world’s most renowned. British museums also are considered among the world’s finest.</p><p>For the more adventuresome, the rest of Europe is literally at the doorstep of people living in the UK. There are affordable ways to travel to the other countries of Europe – particularly for students – with resulting close, easy access to a broad array of other Western cultures, people, and traditions.</p><p>But even students who find study so demanding that it keeps them close to home and allows them little time for travel will be grateful to be “confined” to a country as famously beautiful as the UK. The British countryside, villages, and beaches are famous worldwide for their surpassing beauty. Travel within the country is inexpensive and fast, allowing most visiting students ample opportunities to explore the UK’s riches beyond its university walls.</p><p>Whatever your motives for choosing to study in the UK – and whatever you do to enhance your academic experience while there – you can be sure of one thing. When you return home, everyone will be impressed that you earned your degree in a country known throughout the world for the high quality of its educational offerings. And, with a British degree in your pocket (and brain), you’ll be in a prime position to compete for your country’s best jobs – and find the most satisfying way to take part in a globalised world you have yourself encountered.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Hugh O’Connell is a business owner and university lecturer.

There are very few college students who live by themselves, mostly because it is too expensive. In college towns, rent for a single apartment can reach up to $750 a month. It might not seem like a lot, and maybe it isn’t if your parents are paying for it, but for the majority of students $750 a month is not reasonable. The solution to lower rent is living with roommates. In this article I will talk about the pros and cons of living with roommates, how to find roommates, and I’ll share some of my experiences along the way. This will be a two part post due to its length. Part I will discuss dorm life, while Part II will discuss life after the dorms.</p><p>Since I just graduated from college in April of 2005, I consider myself somewhat of an expert in the college living life. Not much has changed in the few months I have been on my own. I am living by myself for the first time in my life, and let me tell you, it is quite different than being in college.</p><p>Most students start off their college experience living in the dorms. When I moved in, I elected to live in an old fashion dorm. Twenty some odd rooms on the floor with one large communal bathroom. The guys section was separated from the girls section by a lounge/kitchen with one stove, one oven, a few couches, and a TV. Not quite the same as living at home with your own bedroom and bathroom. Most dorms (at least the old fashion ones) do not have single rooms. Everyone has a roommate, and sometimes there are triples in one room. Most schools give you the option to choose your roommate or have one randomly assigned to you. My freshman year, I chose to live with a friend. Make sure you are good friends with this person or else you may end of wanting to kill each other. I have so many friends that wound up hating their roommates. They were friends on the outside, but in the room it was hell.</p><p>I was lucky for the first semester of college. I got along with my roommate for the most part. We led different lives, which was a good thing. I was on the meal plan and he wasn’t. We took different classes at different times and hung out with different people too. In my opinion this is how it has to be if you choose to live with a friend. You can’t be too close or else your friendship will crumble. (Please note that the dorms I am talking about are the ones that are about 12x12 with two twin beds and two desks and enough room to stand up. The new age dorms where people have their own rooms and bathrooms are totally different.) My friend who I roomed with ended up transferring to a new school after our first semester for various reasons. I thought I had it made in the shade. Would the school not know? Would I get the room to myself? The answer was no.</p><p>Enter Kraut (my new roommate from Germany). He was American, but grew up in Germany on a military base. This was one of the best and worst experiences of college. Living with a complete stranger who is the complete opposite of you. This is every incoming freshman’s worst nightmare. Andrew (who I referred to as Kraut... please don’t take offense to this. It was just a friendly joke between us) moved in with me because he was voted out of a triple dorm room by his previous roommates. Wow. After living with him for a semester, I know why they voted him out.</p><p>First off, he was in the ROTC. I have nothing against being a proud American and wanting to serve in the military, but when you have to wake up at 4:00 AM every morning to go run with that squadron, that’s when I start to lose it. His alarm would go off at 3:45 AM everyday and he would snooze for about 30 minutes. He never went to class, so he was there to bug me on all my time off. He played Counter-Strike (which I’m sure all you guys know what it is. Counter-Strike is a terrorist/counter terrorist video game). He played it all through the night with the sound up. You would think me dorm room was a war zone. I tried to take him out with me, or eat lunch with him at the cafeteria, but I just couldn’t take it. I learned a lot from Kraut and will never forget him. My most memorable moment is when I turned the volume all the way up on my PC and blasted the Salute Your Shorts theme song right in his ear while he was sleeping. I captured it all on video. He flicked me off and went to bed. I haven’t seen Kraut since I moved out of the dorm.</p><p>Some Pros and Cons of living in the dorms (once again, I am talking about the old fashioned dorms, not the apartment style ones).</p><p>Pro – Right on campus. You can wake up 5 minutes before class and walk there in your boxer shorts.<br>\r Pro – Right on campus. Food is close by (especially if you are on a meal plan).<br>\r Pro – Social life. You meet a lot of new people living in the dorms. Some become friends for life. Dorms often have mini-parties and social events where everyone hangs out.<br>\r Pro – It’s new. College is about experiencing new things. Dorm life is one of them.<br>\r Pro – It’s cheap. Not nearly as expensive as renting an apartment.<br>\r Pro – It’s very easy to find pick up games for sports.<br>\r Pro – There is an Ethernet computer network. High speed internet access and everyone is connected. Awesome for playing video games. (When I was a freshman things like Napster were brand new. People were downloading music left and right on the high speed network and sharing music like you’ve never seen. And as far as we knew, it was all legal).<br>\r <br>\r Con – No privacy. People will just randomly walk in your room. Keep it locked.<br>\r Con – Old and dirty dorms are no fun. I got sick once a month living in there. I still have breathing problems.<br>\r Con – Dorms are very small. You won’t be able to fit everything you have in your closet.<br>\r Con – Having annoying roommates that you can do nothing about.<br>\r Con - Internet firewalls. Some dorms are real strict now about what you can and can not do on the school’s internet. Sorry guys, no downloading music here.<br>\r Con – Cooking food can be quite a problem. You have no fridge or oven in your room.<br>\r Con – Bugs and rats. Depending on how old your dorm is (mine was built in the 40s I think) you might find rodents running around. We had a rat problem one week. I saw one run right across the floor in my room and then he disappeared into the wall.<br></p><p>Well that is all I have for today.

From scholarships for incoming freshman to federal financial aid. I will give you tips on how to find free money to help you pay for college and discuss those dreaded student loans.', '<p>Well the weekend has come and gone, and I still have no students seeking advice. Please email me your questions, I’m begging you! It’s partly my fault because I’m still slacking on advertising this blog. There’s a lesson for all the students out there. Don’t slack. I slacked a lot of my way through college. It works for the time being, but later on it will come back to haunt you. Try to instill solid work methods now while you still have a chance, or else when you’re twenty-something and working a full-time job, you will only think about ways to get you work done without actually working.</p><p>On to today’s topic: Paying for College. Getting the funds for college and living expenses is one of the biggest challenges you will face, perhaps even tougher than getting into college. If you slacked your way through high school and ended up with poor grades, your chances of a scholarship are not as high. But hopefully you listened to your teachers and parents and did well in school.</p><p>In Florida we have what is called a Florida Bright Futures Scholarship. Based on your grades, SAT/ACT scores, and community service, every graduating senior attending college can receive a 75% tuition scholarship or a 100% + books scholarship. Florida is awesome when it comes to providing every student the means to attend college. I am not sure how other states work, but I would imagine each state has similar scholarship programs.</p><p>Scholarships are what every student needs. Tuition can be very expensive depending on where you go to school and how many classes you take. Out of state schools will cost a student more money. Private schools will also be more expensive. Scholarships give students the ability to attend colleges on someone else’s dime. Pretty sweet deal huh?</p><p>Not all scholarships are based on financial situation like most people think. Generally, students who are in need of financial aid will be given a high priority when it comes to winning a scholarship; however, this is not always the case. Don’t be shy when asking about scholarships. Consult your school counselors, parents, teachers, and friends. You’d be surprised that the company your parents work for probably offer scholarships. Even if it is only for $1000, that is still free money you can’t pass up.</p><p>Scholarships are not limited to incoming freshman either. Current sophomores, juniors, and seniors are eligible for scholarships. Often upper level students are awarded scholarships to further their study in their specific major, such as Education majors. Visit your school’s financial aid office for more information.</p><p>One of the best, if not the best, resources for scholarship information is FastWeb. Every student needs to visit them. Yes, even you seniors. There are thousands of scholarships that go un-awarded every year. So get off this web page (when you’re done reading of course) and go get one.</p><p>http://www.fastweb.com</p><p>Another method of getting money for college is from Uncle Sam himself. No, not your mom’s half brother that you only see on Memorial Day barbeques. I’m talking about the United States Government. The federal government gives out free money to college students. It’s called FAFSA, which stands for Free Application for Federal Student Aid. FAFSA grants are determined by how much money your parents make. You have to fill out a form in your school’s financial aid department or online via their website, www.fafsa.ed.gov. Every student needs to do this. Even if your parents make $500,000 a year, there is still a chance you are eligible for a free grant. A grant is money you do not have to pay back. Ever.</p><p>Let’s say your parents give you $2000 a year for college. You use this for tuition, books, rent, and food (and with all these expenses plus more, $2000 does not go that far). Let’s say you have filled out your FAFSA forms and are given $1000. This is awesome! But wait, it’s been two years and now your little sister is going to college and your parents can’t afford to give you $2,000 each. So they split it up and you each get $1000. What a bummer!! Or is it? FAFSA adjusts your grant according to not only what your parents make, but how many siblings you have in college. The more brothers and sisters you have going to college, the more money you get.</p><p>The most dreaded, but probably most popular, method of paying for college are student loans. Almost all students have them, so don’t feel bad if you are forced to get one. If you’ve taken a finance or economic class you’ve probably heard the terms “good debt” and “bad debt”. Victoria’s Secret credit card debt is “bad debt”, while student loans are “good debt”. Student loans offer the lowest interest rates of any type of loans. Often they give you a grace period after graduation where not a single cent is due. Student loans can be paid off over a long period of time with fixed interest rates.</p><p>Subsidized student loans are loans you get through your school’s financial aid department that the government pays the interest for. Not a bad option either if you are in need of tuition money. Visit your bank or financial aid office for more information on student loans. All banks offer them, so go ask today.</p><p>Finally, the last method of paying for college I’m going to discuss is through good old hard labor. Getting a job can help pay the bills. Waitressing, bartending, retail, and tutoring are all prime examples of college jobs. If you aren’t into working at a restaurant or mall, visit your student career resource center. Jobs on campus are given out to students who are financially needy. The best thing about working on campus is they will fit your work schedule around your classes and tests. You will never have to miss class or work. One of the disadvantages of working on campus is the pay is generally low. You will make a lot more money working at Chili’s than you will your school’s bookstore.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed this article. If you have any further questions about paying for college, please ask.

In this article I will discuss several means of buying books and give you the pros and cons of each method.', '<p>High school students take having free books for granted. Most incoming college freshmen are in for a big shock when they see the price of their new calculus book. That''s what my advice is here for. $150 for one book is a lot to swallow, not to mention the $30 lab manual that comes with it. Oh and did you forget the $15 CD too? Buying textbooks is very, very expensive. On average a student buying his/her books from the school bookstore can expect to pay anywhere from $300-$400. So you’re looking at spending nearly $750 for books the whole year. In this article I am going to discuss some of the unconventional means of acquiring your books for the semester.</p><p>Nearly all incoming students look up their book lists online a week before class starts and buys their books from the university bookstore. People make fun of freshman because they don’t know any better, and this is a prime example. I’ll admit it, I bought my first semester’s books from the university book store, and boy did it show in my pocket book. University bookstores (or bookstores on campus) have the highest mark-up of all stores. You are a fool if you buy your books from them. The only time I recommend buying your book from the university bookstore is when they are the only supplier. For instance, if your professor wrote his own book and you can only buy it through the school.</p><p>The next best method of buying books is from a bookstore off-campus. But even here you will still pay hundreds of dollars for books you probably won’t read. Off-campus bookstores are generally smaller and don’t have the selection size of a university bookstore. If you are buying off-campus be sure to pick your books up early, because they will probably run out.</p><p>In my opinion, the best method of buying books is online. You can not beat the prices. If you are new to college an unfamiliar with sites that sell textbooks, please visit Amazon (I have several links to them on my site). Half.com and Ebay are also excellent places to find new and used textbooks. Most teachers post their required textbooks online a few weeks before the semester starts. This is the perfect time to search Amazon for you book. You have to look early because shipping can take anywhere from a few days to two weeks. If you can wait the shipping time, buying online is the best option. I turned to online buying after my freshman year. It was the best money saving method I used all through college. You turn $350 semester book fees into a mere $150 (or less). It’s amazing how so few students are actually buying online. These companies are 100% safe. There is no reason not to buy online.</p><p>Now I will go through some of the pros and cons of buying books from our three different means.</p><p>On-campus Bookstore<br>\r Pro – prime location<br>\r Pro – save time<br>\r Pro – get the exact editions you need<br>\r Pro – offer new and used books<br>\r Pro – offer buy back plans<br>\r Con – too expensive<br>\r Con – you get like $10 buy back for a $100 book<br>\r Con – not as many used copies<br>\r <br>\r Off-campus Bookstore<br>\r Pro – less expensive<br>\r Pro – lots of used books<br>\r Pro – offer buy backs<br>\r Con – may have older editions<br>\r Con – not located nearby (unless you live off campus)<br>\r Con – small selections<br>\r <br>\r Online Bookstore<br>\r Pro – cheapest books anywhere<br>\r Pro – get exactly the book you need<br>\r Pro – buy anytime<br>\r Con – have to wait 1-2 weeks for delivery<br>\r <br>\r Some other tips on how to save money when it comes to buying books<br>\r Tip 1. Share a book with a friend<br>\r Tip 2. Always buy used<br>\r Tip 3. Buy previous editions (the books don’t change, trust me)<br>\r Tip 4. Look if the book is in e-book form<br>\r Tip 5. Swap books with other students<br>\r <br>\r If you are going to get anything out of this article, the most important point being made is to be smart with your money. Buy your books online. It is by far the cheapest method. You can buy previous editions of the book you need for a fraction of the price. Editions don’t change from year to year. Buying edition 4 instead of 5 will not make a difference. This is based on my experiences, the pages numbers and writing will be exactly the same. Publishing textbooks is all a big scam. They update editions every year or two and expect us to buy them for $150.</p><p>Also, please be cautious when buying books from a bookstore on or near campus. They will tell you “Bring you book back at the end of the year and you will get CASH!” They always make up these gimmicks that put a picture of you stuffing wads of twenties in your wallet. What they don’t tell you is that they don’t always buy books back. If a new edition comes out, guess what, you’re screwed. I would say 75% of the time you will wait in the buy back line and they will say “I’m sorry, we aren’t buying that book back”. If this does happen to you I suggest you make an Amazon account and sell your book online. I’ve done it, and it works.</p><p>For more information on how to save money when buying textbooks, or if you have any questions in general, please email me at collegesos@yahoo.com</p><p><a target="_new" href="http://collegesos.blogspot.com/">http://collegesos.blogspot.com/</a></p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>I am a recent graduate of the University of Florida.

In fact, most high school guidance offices maintain a list of locally based scholarships.  Parents and students would be well advised to explore the range of scholarships for which they may qualify as early as the ninth or tenth grade so they can plan to meet the requirements of as many as possible.</p><p>You should be aware that many private colleges offer substantial scholarships and grants in order to be more competitive with lower cost public institutions and/or attract students who might otherwise enroll elsewhere.  These monies are often offered to students with very little or no demonstrated financial need.  In fact, many private colleges frequently "rebate" 30%-35% (or more) of their tuition revenue in the form of institutional financial aid.  When these funds are factored in, private colleges may ultimately be little or no more expensive for some students to attend than public colleges and universities with lower published fees.</p><p>If you can demonstrate financial need, as established by your answers on the FAFSA\r form at http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/ , you may want to apply to at least a few colleges which meet 100% of demonstrated financial need and do so with a reasonable proportion of gift aid to self-help aid (loans and/or work-study funds).  Take note that although some relatively small number of colleges will meet the full need of all enrolled students, many more will be far more likely to meet or nearly meet the full need of stronger students.</p><p>To position yourself well to be a competitive candidate for scholarships, students should take the most challenging classes available, work diligently to learn as much as possible (not just to get grades), and get involved in co-curricular, community, charitable and/or public service activities.  Here’s a good rule of thumb for all students; the more you have to offer the more you''re likely to be offered.</p><p>Remember three words…research, research, and research. The more time you spend investigating scholarship opportunities, the more likely you are to find scholarships for which you may be eligible.</p><p>Don''t let anyone discourage you. There are lots of people "out there," including some educators, who are inadvertently spreading their serious misconceptions about who may qualify for financial aid and what is required to do so.  Most important of all, do not fail to investigate or apply to a college you like because you think it is too expensive.  That is one of the most common and worst mistakes a family can make.  Remember, you never know what kinds of scholarships and/or financial aid you might receive.</p><p>However, just like you should have "fall back" or "safety" colleges in case you are not admitted to your first choice institutions, you should choose and apply to colleges that will be affordable if you do not receive the financial assistance for which you hope.</p><p>Obvious as it may be, I feel obligated to remind you to pay attention to details and deadlines when applying for scholarships because so many students fail to do so.  I could hardly believe it when an independent educational counselor who probably earns in the neighborhood of $1,000 for helping a student identify and gain admission to appropriate colleges asked (on an email list serve) how many words above the limit one of her counsulees could go on his college application essay.  Don’t make the mistake that she did by assuming there will be no penalty if you “come close” to the requirements or are “only a few days beyond the deadline”.

In this article I will discuss some of the pros and cons of attending a small or large university', '<p>Whether you are a senior in high school picking out a college or already an underclassman at a university and looking to transfer, you still want to be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of your size school. I went to a state university that had over 46,000 students, but I’ve had friends who attend small private schools with 5,000 students. I’m going to take the next few paragraphs to list some of the pros and cons. This is all based on my opinions and my personal experiences at a big time university. My assessment of small private schools might be off because I have never personally attended one.</p><p>Right off the bat when you think of a big university (Texas, Ohio State, University of Florida) you think sports. One of the major advantages of going to a large university is their athletic programs. If you are a sports fan, then attending a Division I football school might factor into your decision. Televised games, pep rallies, homecoming parades, and rivalries are all part of attending a large university. However, you do not have to love sports to go to a D-I school. There are thousands of students at large universities that want nothing to do with sports, and that’s ok because there are plenty of other things to do.</p><p>Large schools also come with large libraries and media centers. There are plenty of places to study and plenty of computer labs to get your work done during class. I used to go to a computer lab (there were hundreds of computers in there) in between my classes and surf the web or complete my homework from the night before. At a small school there may only be one library and it might be too far out of your way. At a big school, there’s a library, study hall, or computer lab on every corner.</p><p>Food is another advantage of attending a large university. They have several dining halls and not to mention Dunkin’ Donuts, Starbucks, Chik-Fil-A, Taco Bell, Pizza hut, and basically every other fast food joint you can think of right in the middle of campus. You can get food anywhere. And the dining halls actually have eatable food. They don’t serve Helda’s three day old meatloaf and peas. We had freshly baked omelets with bacon and pancakes every morning. I bet you can’t get that at Flagler College.</p><p>Some other quick advantages of a large university are the social aspects (fraternities and sororities, intramurals, clubs, student government, and so on). Most universities have a distinguished faculty that know what they are doing. Another advantage is there is on-campus housing for freshman (and sometimes sophomores). This gives you to opportunity to wake up 10 minutes before class starts and walk there in your PJs.</p><p>Some disadvantages of a large school are the enormous sized classes. It’s likely you can have a class with 900 people. No matter what you say or how many questions you ask in class, the professor won’t know your name. Many classes are taught by Teacher’s Assistants, which means you are not getting as high a quality as you would like. At a large university you are just a number to some people, and you can get lost in the crowd. Finally, all professors think they are hot shots and care more about their own research than helping students.</p><p>Small universities on the other hand have smaller classes. These smaller classes may put more emphasis on learning and hands-on experience. I have never attending a small university but most likely they have more individualized majors. It is not a set curriculum that thousands of people follow every semester. With smaller classes students are able to get to know their professors better. This is great from when its time to find letters of recommendation. Try getting a letter from a teacher when you were just one of 900 students in the class.</p><p>Another pro for attending a small college is the advisors know the students very well. Try seeing an advisor at the college of liberal arts at a major university. They see a hundred kids a day and won’t ever remember your name or what classes you’re taking. Also, there is a greater sense of community at a small school. You aren’t just a number on an ID card, here you are a person with a face and a name.</p><p>If you have any more questions about university size, feel free to email me at collegesos@yahoo.com</p><p><a target="_new" href="http://collegesos.blogspot.com/">http://collegesos.blogspot.com/</a></p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>I am a recent graduate of the University of Florida.

In my opinion this is a wise decision and an excellent opportunity to experience new things. However, not all freshmen live in the dorms. Some move straight into apartments, condos, or houses. In College Roommates Part II, I will discuss my experiences living with roommates in an apartment. Not all are good, but overall apartment life in 100 times better than being in a dorm.</p><p>I moved into my first apartment in August of my sophomore year. I decided to find a place with a friend (we’ll call him Mike) I have known for years. We asked several of our other high school friends to live with us, but no one was available. We drastically searched for two more roommates. We wanted to live in a four bedroom apartment because of the social atmosphere, but mostly because it is cheaper than living in a two bedroom. We eventually found two guys to live with us. They happened to live in the dorms with Mike, so they were friends of his but total strangers to me. I was not worried one bit. After living with Kraut in the dorms, nothing could be worse, after all, in the apartment I would have my own room and own bathroom.</p><p>Apartments are so much nicer than dorms. You get your privacy back (well most of it), you get more space, and you get a better sense of independence. I had my own desk and my own computer. I had my own mini fridge in my bedroom and my own dresser. The only things we had to share were things in the living room. We chose to stay in one of the more social apartment complexes known for parties and fun times. We had an already furnished apartment that included all utilities and cable T.V. with the rent. We had our own washer and dryer too.</p><p>Living in my first apartment was one of the best years of my life. My new roommates turned out to be awesome people. We have all remained friends to this day. Having four guys in one apartment comes with its positives and its negatives. Some of the positives are always having people to play sports with (I can’t count the number of times we played 2v2 basketball), always having someone to play video games with, having friends to go out with, and just being able to have fun with friends. But when you live with three other guys’ things can get messy. Trash piles up everyday, no one cleans the kitchen, and someone always wants to party the night you have an exam to study for.</p><p>Overall my first (and only) apartment experience was a good one. I made two solid friends there, although I didn’t meet many other people in the apartment complex. We had good times, especially when we bought a ping pong table for the living room, and great memories. I would highly recommend everyone to live in an apartment at least one year during their college career that is unless you have a sweet condo or house.</p><p>My junior and senior year of college, my friend Mike and I decided to move into a condo with two of our friends from back home. Our roommates from the apartment were cool with it, and they both went to live with two other their friends from back home. We chose to move into the condo because A. it was cheaper and B. we needed a new scene. By moving in with a friend whose parents owned the condo, we did not have to pay a security deposit or any hidden fees. Our rent was straight forward and included all utilities. We had everything from the apartment and more.</p><p>The only downfall from living in the condo was that it was old. Things got moldy and things fell a part. Not all of it was normal wear and tear. During my stay at the condo, I survived 4 hurricanes, one of which was a direct hit. Florida got pounded in August of my senior year. Those hurricanes ripped the condo complex up, and the condo association did nothing to fix it. Trees were everywhere, roofing and siding came off, and mold and leakage grew in our rooms. Luckily we were able to control it.</p><p>We also had a dog while living in the condo. One of my roommates brought her home because she was abandoned. She was a sweet dog in the end, but a pain while a puppy. She chewed everything and peed on everything she didn’t chew.</p><p>If I had to pick living in an apartment or living in a condo, I would choose the condo probably 8/10 times. They both have their pros and they both have their cons. I met some of my best friends living in both the apartment and condo. I did meet my girlfriend through one of my condo roommates and Mike met his girlfriend because she lived in the condo next to us. You can’t go wrong either way. Anything is better than living in a dorm. I never lived in a house so I can not touch on that subject as much.

The following article will give you some tips about what to do when choosing your major. I''ve compiled these tips based on my recent experiences in college.', '<p>So you''re an incoming freshman or an underclassman who is still undecided and the question everyone asks you "What''s your major?" is getting on your last nerves. I''ve heard it a thousand times, and trust me, the only question you will hate being asked more than "What''s your major?" is "What do you want to do after graduation?". But we''ll get into the graduation question some other day. For now let''s concentrate on choosing your major.</p><p>I went to freshman orientation at the University of Florida not knowing what I wanted to do with my life (and honestly, 6 months after graduation and working in the real world, I still don''t know the answer). Like many of you, I felt pressure to give the advisors an answer. I told them Civil Engineering. Bad mistake on my part. Never Never Never pick engineering as your major unless you are dead sold on it. I was stupid and signed up for a year''s worth of Calculus and Chemistry.</p><p>But the good thing about college and choosing your major is that you can always change it. You can change your major seven times if you want. I only changed my major twice, which is probably about normal. What is not normal is picking a major and sticking to it. You are in the vast minority if you go all four years with the major you picked at orientation, but kudos to you for sticking with it.</p><p>Try to evaluate what you like and enjoy doing. If you love computers, research your school''s computer science degrees. If your passion is in sports, pursue a sport management degree (that''s what I did). If you love kids, by all means declare yourself an education major. But do not feel that you are stuck with it. Explore the programs and keep your options open.</p><p>Choosing a major does not necessarily mean you will land a job in that field. I earned a Bachelor''s in Sport Management and here I am building a web page and writing articles about college life. Your degree does not limit you career opportunities. Unless you choose a very specific degree, like software engineering or accounting, your career opportunities are very open. Even with specific degrees you can find jobs in areas unrelated.</p><p>When it comes to picking a minor or going after a second degree, try to pick something relevant to your field of study. To accompany my sport management degree, I earned a business management minor. Both compliment each other. Do not get a computer science bachelor''s and an entomology minor. They are completely irrelevant to each other and won''t be impressive on your resume (unless you have a true love for bugs, then stick to something relevant). The same goes with double majoring. Don''t double major just for bragging rights. It will be a big waste of time. If you love the challenge, love studying, and hard work then explore the option of getting a second degree. Do not go straight into orientation with that go go attitude of "Oh my god I''m going to be a double major in bimolecular chemistry and nuclear microbiology and I''m going to take all honors courses so I can graduate in two and a half years". It doesn''t work like that, and you won''t make it unless your name is Doogie Howser. Wait a semester or two before declaring a second major.</p><p>Tip #1. Don''t pick your major because it''s what your mother or father do.</p><p>Tip #2. If you are unsure at orientation, don''t feel pressured into choosing a major right away. It''s ok to be undeclared for a semester or two.</p><p>Tip #3. Be happy with your degree. If you hate the classes you are in, think about making a change.</p><p>Tip #4. Don''t declare a second major right away.</p><p>Tip #5. Pick a minor that compliments your major.</p><p>Tip #6. Pick a major in a field of study you enjoy. If you enjoy reading books about Art, then look into being an Art History major. If Art bores you to death, don''t be an Art major.</p><p>Tip #7. Take advantage of your school''s career resource center. (I never did, and boy did I regret it when it took me 4 months to find a job).</p><p>If you have any comments or questions, please feel free to email me at collegesos@yahoo.com or visit my website at</p><p><a target="_new" href="http://collegesos.blogspot.com/">http://collegesos.blogspot.com/</a></p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>I am a recent graduate of the University of Florida.

Know what type of reference list your professor wants, as well as what style she wants it in - and be on your way to a stellar research paper.', '<p>No matter what type of paper you''re writing, be it a literature review, research report, summary, or analysis, rest assured that you''ll be required to name your sources.  There are several different types of resource lists, not to mention a number of different styles for writing entries.</p><p>A reference list, also called a list of works cited, is a catalog of all the sources you cited or otherwise referred to in your paper.  A citation involves giving another author credit for a quote, idea, finding, or phrase that you use in your paper.  You should cite all direct quotes, as well as instances of paraphrasing; original or novel ideas, perspectives, and facts; and research findings.  This is necessary so that authors receive due credit for their work.  It''s also an academic obligation: it provides your readers the opportunity to locate the sources you used, read and interpret the evidence themselves, and perhaps even challenge your conclusions.</p><p>In contrast to reference lists, you list all the sources you read in a bibliography.  Even if you do not cite the source, it must receive a mention in the bibliography if you used it in any way throughout the research and writing processes.  Thus, books and articles you consulted for reference early on must be included in your bibliography, receiving the same attention as those sources you cited extensively.</p><p>In addition to various types of resource lists, there are also different styles in which you can compile them.  Your professor will tell you whether she wants you to use a reference list or bibliography, along with what style your list should be presented in.  This information will most likely be in the assignment itself, so read through your handouts carefully.  When in doubt, it''s better to ask the professor than guess!</p><p>One of the most popular styles is Modern Language Association (MLA) style.  Founded in 1883, the MLA is a professional association that promotes the study and teaching of - you guessed it - language and literature.  MLA Style is the format recommended for bibliographies by the Association.  Along with the styles developed by the University of Chicago Press and the APA, it''s one of the "big three" styles.  The MLA guidelines are used by more than 125 scholarly journals, newsletters, and magazines, and are quite common in high schools and colleges.  You are likely to encounter them at some point in your academic career.</p><p>The University of Chicago Press also publishes a style guide, called The Chicago Manual of Style.  Now in its 15th edition, the manual explains not only how to document your resources, but also how to deal with copyright issues, design and produce a book, and everything in between.  The manual has humble origins, starting out as a sheet of typographical basics in the 1890s, morphing into a short pamphlet first published in 1906, and now weighing in at a hefty 986 pages.  Aimed at publishers, editors, and writers, you might have to learn this style if you are majoring communications or related fields.</p><p>Also mentioned earlier were the guidelines developed by the American Psychological Association (APA).  If you''re taking a psychology or other social science course, odds are that you''ll be using this style for your reference list.  The APA is the largest association of psychologists, with over 150,000 members and 53 divisions.  The APA''s Publication Manual is a comprehensive resource for both students and professionals who wish to publish their research.  Along with guidelines for writing a reference list, the Publication Manual also includes information on how to organize your paper''s content; how to express your ideas coherently; ethical standards for reporting research findings; and how to develop and submit a manuscript for publication.  If you ever plan on publishing work in psychology, sociology, social work, criminology, nursing, business or economics, you will need to know APA style forwards and backwards!</p><p>There are a number of other style guides available; each field prefers a specific style, and many have developed their own guidelines.  Thus, you should always double check with your professor to see what style she wants you to use.</p><p>Even though the reference list falls at the end of your paper, make no mistake - it''s extremely important!  Any errors you make could inadvertently deny an author credit for her work.  Incorrect citations might make it difficult or impossible for your peers to do their own research on the topic.  Failure to properly credit your sources could get you in big trouble, whether it''s an intentional omission or not.  Compiling the list in the incorrect format, while not as serious as excluding it altogether, may still annoy your professor.</p><p>The reference list is more than an afterthought.  Afford it as much attention as you do the rest of your paper, and be well on your way to a stellar research report!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Copyright Kelly Garbato, 2005</p><p>Kelly Garbato is an author, ePublisher, and small business owner.

It seems like there are so many things going on, like assignments, projects, and extracurricular activities.  Now a test is coming up and you''ve got to do well on it.  How should you <b>study</b> so you do better on that test?</p><p>First of all, when you <b>study for a test</b>, you shouldn''t be learning something completely new.  It is faster and easier to recall something you have already learned than to learn something completely new.  After each day of classes, it is a good idea to review everything you have learned.  It doesn''t have to be a long review either.  Simply jog through the day''s topics.  That way, you give your brain another chance to soak up the information.  Hopefully, this review will make future studying less time consuming and less of a learning process.</p><p><b>Where you study</b> is important.  Find a place that''s readily available with minimal distractions.  A popular place to study is home.  However, for some, home can be too distracting as it is easy to get sidetracked.  What may help is if you study in a place that''s similar to the place where you''re going to take the test.  When you study, you might associate certain topics with the environment.  So if you take the test in a similar environment, you can more easily retrieve these associations.  For example, if you''re going to write a test in a gymnasium, it may help to study in a gymnasium.</p><p>Some people <b>study well in a group</b> since they can get help from others in areas in which they are lacking.  They may also gain insight from others on what they have overlooked and which areas to focus on for the test.  On the other hand, some people <b>study well alone</b>.  They know what they have to study.  Also, a group can be distracting as they engage in off-topic conversation or try to do everything but study.  You''re the one who knows yourself the best, so determine what works best for you.</p><p>There are a variety of methods you can use when studying.  For example, when studying for a test, you can do different things, like reading through your textbook, reading through course notes, answering textbook questions, redoing past assignments, reviewing previous tests, researching online, talking with others, and more.  You can also use <b>memory-improving techniques</b> like mnemonics, visualization, and association.  Try a combination of different studying methods and track your results.</p><p>A method that works well for most people is studying in <b>small pieces</b> instead of large blocks of time.  Studying in large blocks of time increases the chance that you will overwhelm your brain with information and start forgetting things.  If you study in small pieces of time, you aren''t absorbing all of this information at once and get chances to rest.  Furthermore, you should rehearse what you study and do it in <b>expanding time intervals</b>.  For example, if you study ten digits of PI, you could attempt to rehearse the ten digits in one minute, then two minutes, then four minutes, and so on.</p><p>In addition, <b>state of being</b> is important for studying.  It has been shown that if you study while intoxicated, you will do better if you take the test while intoxicated.  If you study while sober, you will do better if you take the test while sober.  The sober case showed better results than the intoxicated case.  Thus it''s better to stay away from the drinks while studying and while taking the test.</p><p>Finally, make sure you <b>eat healthy</b> and get a <b>good night''s sleep</b> before the test.  If you think there is not enough time to sleep, take a look at some time management tips so you can help use and manage your time more efficiently.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Derick Yung is the webmaster for Derick''s Magic: The Gathering at <a target="_new" href="http://www.dericksmagic.com/">http://www.dericksmagic.com/</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

Active reading increases your understanding and comprehension of the text - and ultimately your grades as well!', '<p>This might sound silly, but there is a “right” and a “wrong” way of reading.   This is especially true for students, who are expected to summarize, analyze, and critique the readings assigned to them by their professors.  The task can be particularly daunting to students who are working on a term paper, since they need to read a number of materials and then integrate them into the ongoing discourse that is their research paper.</p><p>So what forms of reading are “right,” and which are “wrong”?  While reading a book or article, you want to read actively as opposed to passively.  When you read passively, you are just receiving information; as you read, you aren''t digesting the information and forming an opinion.  Of course, this is not very conducive to critical thinking, a practice for which you should always endeavor.</p><p>In contrast, active reading is a more interactive process.  Active readers are participants in the reading process.  As they pour over the text, they interact with it; they question it, challenge it, gather evidence and present counterevidence, converse with it even.  Active reading helps you comprehend and recall what you have read, and ultimately makes for a better paper.</p><p>This explanation probably sounds pretty vague.  Nonetheless, active reading isn''t just an abstract theoretical concept - there are concrete steps you can take towards becoming a more active reader!</p><p>Firstly, don''t approach a text with the assumption that you have to read it straight through, from beginning to end.  Before you even start, scan through the title, the abstract, the table of contents and the index.  This provides a framework for the rest of the readings.  As you move on to the text itself, do not be afraid to skip from chapter to chapter or section to section.  If you are reading a book, look at the index to see when your topic is mentioned.  For research reports, try reading the conclusion before the results; this will give you a general idea of the author''s findings and will help you understand the specifics as presented in the results section.  If a statement or subject has you confused, don''t be afraid to backtrack and reread a paragraph or even an entire chapter, if need be.  After all, if you don''t understand a topic, it will be awfully hard to write coherently about it!</p><p>Active reading also involves forming an opinion of what you are reading.  As you take in the text, pay attention to your emotional reactions to it.  Does it make you angry?  Upset?  Incredulous?  Why?  Does the author make any claims that you find dubious?  What have you read to date that supports or contradicts the author''s arguments?  Does the author offer credible evidence for his statements, or is he just presenting his opinions or making speculations?  Mark down these questions and your impressions as you go.</p><p>Another means of breaking the passive reading habit is to make use of those margins.  This is easy if you are reading a photocopy or printout of an article.  On the other hand, if you''re reading a text, photocopy any sections you plan on using in your paper so that you can mark them up without defacing the library''s property!  It will save you a ton of time, so it''s well worth the extra expense.  You can also save documents on your computer as Word files (rather than printing out hard copies) and “mark” them up using Word''s highlighting function.  This conserves both money and paper!</p><p>Marking in the margins gives you pause to consider what you''ve read.  It also draws your attention to important passages and makes note of them for future use.  You can jot down anything that comes to mind.  Underline or highlight important facts, statements, or findings in the text.  Use arrows to connect relevant sections to one another and denote relationships.  Write down any questions you might have.  Is there something you don’t understand?  A new avenue you might want to pursue?  A topic that you need to research further?  Make note of it!  Single out any inconsistencies in the text along with points of discussion or debate.  Gather evidence that supports or defies your viewpoint.  Don''t shy away from statements you don''t understand or can''t explain - these are what you should pay closest attention to.</p><p>Consider not just the text in front of you, but the context in which it was written.  Examine the time period in which the source was written.  Your analysis should also include the perspective the author''s writing from - is she a psychologist or a biologist?  How about a feminist, or perhaps a Marxist?  How might the context influence the author''s conclusions?  Keep these questions in mind as you read, and make note of any impressions you have while reading.</p><p>After you have finished a chapter or article, write up a brief summary.  Not only will this aid in your understanding of what you''ve just read, but it will provide a helpful guide for later, when you''re writing your paper and need to sort through hundreds of pages of material.  Besides, if you can''t easily write a paragraph or two, this is a clue that you need to go back and reread the source.</p><p>Don''t wait until you''re assigned a paper to try out these suggestions.  The next time you need to do any reading for class, practice some active reading strategies.

Find out how these medical professionals are learning to up the ante online.', '<p>An online nursing program might initially sound like impracticability: of all the health services, nursing is arguably the most hands-on of the lot. While doctors might traditionally, and somewhat stereotypically, be considered the brains behind the healthcare operation, nurses have been seen as the heart. They look after patients’ basic and daily needs, performing intimate tasks with dignity. The uninitiated might thus be led to ask – how on earth can this be learned at an online nursing program?</p><p>There lingers a certain preconception about online educational facilities, including online nursing schools, despite the fact that we have embraced the Internet wholeheartedly into other areas of our lives. But online schools are an extremely viable option today, when many people find themselves without the time or money to devote to full time education, but are eager to benefits from the increased range of career options that further education can provide. But surely there are certain disciplines that cannot be taught remotely, without the one on one tuition and observation of a trained educator?</p><p>This is simply not the case at all. While it is true that a basic nursing qualification must be obtained on campus, it is no longer the case that anyone who wishes to improve their education and earn the financial and personal rewards that accompany this must spend long hours in classrooms. Online nursing schools can offer the same kind of advancement that campus-based classes provide, but allow the individual to study in their own time, and at their own pace. There are many excellent online nursing programs available today.</p><p>It is wise to invest some time in exploring which online nursing school is most appropriate to your particular needs. Be sure to locate a program that is accredited, these are programs that you are sure will offer you the very best in terms of content and support, and illustrate to future employers the quality of the skills you have to offer. Some courses do provide a contact person, or even a personal tutor, that you can call upon should you require some individual help – this is another aspect to explore if you think that this might be helpful for you. It boils down to personal needs and choice – a course that might be suitable for a colleague or co-worker might not be the best for you, so explore your own preferred learning style – whether you absorb information best by reading prescribed texts, or doing your own research, for example – and try to find an online nursing school whose teaching methods are best suited to you. There are many accredited online nursing programs to choose from.</p><p>So if you would like to further your nursing career but, like most nurses, have an extremely busy schedule, don’t assume that the only way forward is in devoting your precious free time to falling asleep in classrooms. There are huge benefits that accompany the furthering of your education with a degree obtained through an online nursing program – by increasing your qualifications, you open to yourself a world of new opportunities that will allow you consider exploring other areas of nursing, different jobs in the field, and the upward motion that will ensure the increase in pay that you deserve. There are other options that will allow you progress towards these benefits as your time and energy permit. An online nursing program might be just the way to get you there.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>My name is Fiona Condron, and I am a freelance writer.

Proper education and reputed college degree can help one grab better job opportunities and demand higher salary from employers. But owing to certain circumstances or due to lack of funds one is usually restrained from getting a college degree. Online universities present a lucrative option for people with time constraints. Amount of benefits achieved from completing online courses greatly depend on the reputation of the online university. An erroneous choice of online training institute results in your wasting precious time and invaluable money. Hence it is very important to choose a competent university that provides maximum knowledge with minimum cost and time involvement. Factors governing the choice for online institution of higher education are-</p><p>Accreditation of institute</p><p>Genuine accreditation of institute is a prime factor while determining its creditability. Being accredited from regional authorities renders universities a higher reputation. Students graduating from these places stand a better chance to obtain higher salaries and better jobs. Also eligibility towards student loan gets higher if concerned authority accredits the enrolled institution. Inter course student loan transfers are possible for transfers within similar regional universities.</p><p>Research the quality and relevance of course offered</p><p>Learning anything that is irrelevant in today’s scenario would result in useless accumulation of knowledge that does not turn to be fruitful. An enquiry about the university’s capability of adaptation towards changing technologies is important. Analyzing the syllabus offered by proposed university by comparing it with other online institutes presenting similar coaching would help determine whether the curriculum is exhaustive or not. An examination about the course being suitable to one’s capabilities and interests is again very important.</p><p>Cost involved</p><p>Online universities offer personalized education program for adult learners. Hence at times they might occur to be more costly. A considerably low fee charged by online university is a matter of concern as that may be due to low quality education imparted by them. Untalented faculty members are available at low costs and that may be a reason behind reduced fee structure. Sometimes even if the cost of education is higher it is worth the effort as availing student loans is easy. Expected increase in money earned after completion of the course would help repay the loan amount.</p><p>Admission requirements</p><p>Formalities and academic qualification that are essential to enroll for a particular course are indicative of the universities standard of education. Imparting admission only on the basis of money payment capacity should lower the credibility of the university. As certain minimum academic qualification must be mandatory prior to enroll for graduate courses. Not having any such restrictions results in accumulation of unworthy students who would latter be one’s fellow mates.</p><p>Investigate the faculty and alumni</p><p>Enquiry about the faculties, educational qualifications are indicative of the online universities competence to impart training.

So you will definitely find a university that meets your budget.</p><p>•	After course and its fees comes the issue of classes, duration of the course etc. It is always prudent to opt for a university that provides lot many classes. For taking classes is an excellent way to comprehend the subject, clarify your doubts and difficulties and also to keep in touch with your studies. Also see the timings of the classes and tenure of the course. For the online education is just not quite beneficial if you are not able to take classes due to job or any other work and fail to do well in exams. Moreover the span of the course should be suitable to you.</p><p>•	Then what matters is the faculty of the university. Take a look at the faculty directory and see the qualification of the concerned teachers.</p><p>•	It is always better to go for a university that caters to job facility. If the online university itself does not recommend any placements then its degree should be one that fetches you a good job. This is basically concerned with the university’s reputation. The university’s remarkable reputation is a significant factor in fetching a respectable job. There are some sites that rank various online universities on the basis of their academic status.

Look deeply now into your reflection and state out loud, “I’d rather be happy today with who I am right now without reason instead of waiting for some day when I hopefully become something better.”</p><p>* Student:<br> \r Aaaa…okay, “I’d rather be happy today with who I am right now without reason instead of waiting for someday when I hopefully become something better.”</p><p>* The NTU Elder:<br> \r Good, now say it louder.</p><p>* Student:<br> \r “I’d rather be happy today with who I am right now without reason, instead of waiting for someday when I hopefully become something better!”</p><p>* The NTU Elder:<br> \r Excellent, now take a slow deep breath, feel the words in your throat, and say it again….but this time truly believe it.</p><p>* Student:<br>\r …“I’D RATHER BE HAPPY TODAY WITH WHO I AM RIGHT NOW WITHOUT REASON INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR SOMEDAY WHEN I HOPEFULLY BECOME SOMETHING BETTER!”</p><p>* The NTU Elder:<br> \r Very good. Now when you continue to say this, you’re actually altering your state of mind from a hopeless slave of your desires, to a soldier of happiness and opportunity. Do you understand the simplicity of this transformation?</p><p>* Student:<br>\r Yes, I feel better already.</p><p>* The NTU Elder:<br> \r Good. Whenever you feel low, remember this quick exercise and repeat it out loud. What have you got to lose?</p><p>* Student:<br>\r Nothing, I guess.</p><p>* The NTU Elder:<br> \r Good guess.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The Mysterious no-named “Elder” continues to drop some deep knowledge regarding the foundation of the NTU motto. \r (With Joe’s Translations in Parentheses)</p><p>The more we analyze the things that happen to us, the clearer it becomes that everything we encounter is filtered through our individual points of view. If we have a point of view that the world is out to get us, everyday will seem like just another onslaught that we have to fend off. If our point of view is that everything is a waste of time, then all of our results will be lame at best.</p><p>On the other hand, if our point of view is one of having “Nothing 2 Lose,” we won’t care about the possible embarrassing or negative results of our actions. Every situation we encounter using the “Nothing 2 Lose” outlook will turn into a win-win/no-lose lifestyle.</p><p>The “Nothing 2 Lose” lifestyle works like this: Imagine that you are attending a social gathering. Across the room is a student whom you find attractive and would like to get to know better. If you let your perceived fears prevent you from interacting with that person, the gravity of the situation will weigh heavily on your reflection in the water (You will begin to get down on yourself.</p><p>Example: “Oh well, she would probably hate me anyway if I talked to her.” Or “I’ll never meet anyone. I’m going to be alone for a long time.”). Then after repeated failures to interact with people whom you are interested in, your image in the pond will actually begin to drowned. This means you become more and more depressed and self-hating as you continually let opportunities slip away).</p><p>When your reflection begins to sink deep into the pond (This is when you beat yourself up for not taking action. Example: “Damn me! Why can’t I just go over and talk with her? My life sucks!” Or “I can’t believe I let him walk away without saying anything, again!”), you will indeed feel the lack of air in your lungs. This lack of oxygen will be consistent and unrelenting until the moment you begin resurrecting your distant image in the dark pond water (You will begin to feel better when you finally let go of your fears and take immediate action and engage that fellow student whom you find attractive in a conversation).</p><p>However, without direct action, your reflection can remain trapped in this watery grave for years (You could spend a very long time being depressed, alone and disliking yourself). Whereupon, you will begin to believe that you are inferior to students who manage to remain above water and full of breath (You’ll hate others for being able to do what you won’t let yourself do).</p><p>Next, through your feelings of inadequacy, you will build up a false sense of security by telling yourself that it is not your fault that you’re stuck below the surface of the pond and can’t breathe (You’ll convince yourself that your depression is everyone else’s fault). Rather than taking responsibility for your plight, you will blame the places that you go to, and you will convince yourself that the people you fail to interact with are in wrong in one way or another. Yet deep down you know that the only difference between the breathing and the breathless is simple and straightforward action.</p><p>When you learn to calm the winds of your hesitation and reclaim your rightful place above the water, the words you choose and the results that follow are meaningless. For once you take the action of interaction with someone you find appealing, you are guaranteed a win-win situation. No matter what he or she says back to you, you will know you have done all you could do at that given point in time to make your reflection in the pond rise high above the trappings of breathless solitude (You’ll have taken action and done all you could to fulfill your heart).</p><p>This rising above the water of which I speak is certainly an uncertain and daunting task to say the least. Very few students can bring themselves face to face with rejection and possible embarrassment. That is why true happiness is reserved for only those NTU students who know that the choices between interacting (breathing) and seclusion (drowning) are not so much choices as the are sentences. While one option offers a life without limits, the other one sentences its victims to an undetermined stint in personal solitary confinement. Therefore the appearance of a choice is only that...an appearance.</p><p>Fret not my young pupil, learning to breathe may seem difficult at first, but once you begin, the hardest part is behind you. Once implemented, the “Nothing 2 Lose” lifestyle grows proportionately stronger as you use it and begin to take control of your happiness. The best realization in life is when you experimentally understand that your happiness is completely under your control. Take a moment to imagine how extraordinary it will be to have complete freedom from your fears, anxiety and the constant threat of downing your reflection. Your social, academic and love life will flourish even though every physical aspect of your life is exactly the same as it has always been. The only change in your life will of course be the invisible transformation of your point of view.</p><p>You can start by practicing the “Nothing 2 Lose” in everyday situations like expressing an opinion in class or making the “Clear the Air” phone call to someone you have been arguing with and haven’t spoken to in a long time. The natural high you will get from controlling the path of your own happiness will be 100% addictive. All you have to do is get out of your own way.</p><p>Living the “Nothing 2 Lose” goes way beyond social situations. It goes to the place where we generate our self-worth and dances around until our reflection in the pond smiles back at us. This lifestyle allows us to live in action, free from the prison of lonely observation. \r Look into your reflection my young friend. I am always in there saying, “When trying to walk on water worry about the third step when you take your first.”</p><p>*** Joe’s Final Translation ***</p><p>“If you worry about the first step, you’ll never get started because it’s the start that stops most students.”</p><p>Please visit: http://www.collegelifesecrets.com for all the details.

Today there are countless options for getting yourself an online education, depending on your specific needs and goals. Therefore making the right choice that will be most suited to your schedule and learning style as well as the course itself is of prime importance.</p><p>1.  Be clear about your needs</p><p>Different people have different needs for getting an online education. Before you begin considering your options, do some introspection to determine what kind of education you seek, how you can schedule your online education to fit into your routine, how much time and effort you are prepared to spare and whether it is personal fulfillment or career advancement that you aim to achieve through the course.</p><p>2. Investigate your options</p><p>The Internet is teeming with offers of online education for every conceivable purpose. So take the time to gather information about the options that suit you. Most schools provide free information kit on their education programs that can help you get a better idea of what’s in store if you choose to enroll with any of them. You have the option of conducting searches according to the type of courses you are interested in and colleges based on locations. Make sure you have a clear idea of the program being offered before you invest your hard earned money and time into any one of them.</p><p>3.  Be wary of scams</p><p>As with all offers on the Internet, there is no dearth of scams that you need to be wary of when doing your searches for the right course. If you’ve heard about a course through a spam e-mail, steer clear of it. Fake degrees and credentials are plentiful and you’ll only be wasting your time, effort and money if you go with one of them.</p><p>4.  Look for accreditation</p><p>Accreditation of the school or institute that you enroll in, is of vital importance. After all if the reason you are pursuing further education is to advance your career, the degree you will be earning needs to be recognized by your employers or prospective employers.</p><p>5.  What are the facilities being offered</p><p>Different online courses have different facilities to offer their students. Many offer services like tutoring, reference links, library access, technical assistance, discussion threads, interaction with fellow students and a variety of other features. Depending on the kind of study aids that are likely to benefit you, make your choice based on the kind of facilities you can avail once you enroll for a course.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Jean Chortillion enjoys writing about online education.

Study guides that are \r available online or in the bookstores will provide you with \r practice tests. Practice tests will give you invaluable \r practice as well as the general ‘feel’ of the exam. Time \r yourself when taking the practice tests to familiarize \r yourself with the time pressure of the real exam.</p><p>Assess yourself. Take diagnostic or practice tests. Analyze \r the result. Mark the areas you could consider your weak \r areas. Concentrate on these areas when you begin studying.</p><p>Draft a study plan. The study plan must include the time \r frame you will follow along with the topics you need to \r cover. This will help you systematize your study habits.</p><p>Guidelines for the Test Day:</p><p>Eat a healthy meal the night before the exam. Having a \r healthy meal will effectively nourish your faculties. You \r need to be at your best when you take the test, which \r includes being properly nourished and hydrated.</p><p>Get plenty of sleep. Make sure to have at least 7 to 8 hours \r of sleep the night before the test. You need to be well \r rested and relaxed. You don’t want to be drowsy and confused \r when you take the test, right?</p><p>Get up early. By early we mean giving yourself enough time \r to be fully awake when you take the test. The time here is \r quite relative. Some people are fully awake a few minutes \r after waking up, while some could use an hour or so.</p><p>Eat a healthy breakfast. Have a nutritious breakfast. Make \r sure you don’t eat too much. You have to be energized \r enough, but not too full when you take the exam.</p><p>Wear comfortable clothes and dress in layers. You don’t want \r to be too hot or too cold. You cannot afford to be \r distracted by anything while taking the test.</p><p>College entrance exams need thorough preparation.

Libraries have adapted to the Digital Age and taken their holdings online.', '<p>Although researching and writing a college paper has never been child’s play, it was a bit more straightforward and less complicated before the advent of the Internet.  Aspiring student researchers simply visited their university’s library, where they could easily check out a few relevant books after consulting the card catalog and use a periodical index to find a journal article or two.  Nowadays, there are many more choices in addition to those regular, “old-fashioned” standbys.  Still, the Internet has yet to render the library obsolete!</p><p>The World Wide Web has become a boundless source of information, bringing knowledge to the homes of millions.  Yet, despite the tens of billions of pages available online, it''s a mistake to conclude that everything is available (somewhere!) on the Web.  Contrary to popular belief, the entire world''s wisdom is not online and free for the taking.  Some information will cost you, while other resources are nowhere to be found.</p><p>Additionally, the Web is rife with misinformation.  Unfortunately, many students not only turn first to the Internet for their research needs, but they are also handicapped by their inability to distinguish reputable resources from unreliable ones.  While use of the Internet can make research more convenient, it may also result in carelessness.  Students are better served by beginning their research at the library and using the Web as a secondary resource.</p><p>Fortunately, the Internet has also changed the way in which the supposedly passé library functions.  While you may still see drawers upon drawers of card catalogs, most libraries have also made their catalogs available online.  Computers have facilitated interlibrary loan (ILL) as well.  Likewise, paper journals and microfiche persist, but these resources are supplemented with subscriptions to online academic databases.  Ultimately, libraries have used the Internet to provide the best of both worlds - the reputable resources available at the library, digitalized for greater accessibility.</p><p>1.   Online Catalogs</p><p>In all likelihood, you''ve probably already used a card catalog, even if it was way back in elementary school.  While catalogs do still exist, the good news is that most of them have been digitalized.  Now available online, they''re much easier to access and search.  If you can connect to your library''s computer system remotely, you can even browse their holdings from your dorm room!</p><p>Online catalogs generally consist of records of the library''s holdings (books, journals, dissertations, manuscripts, etc.), as opposed to the holdings themselves.  A record can include any of the following information: author, title, publisher, date and place of publication, journal title, subject, and keywords.</p><p>You might be tempted to dismiss catalogs since they don''t provide instant gratification - immediate, full-text access to all available resources.  However, you can access many of the holdings either via online academic databases or in the library itself - all it takes is a little detective work!</p><p>Other libraries offer access to their catalogs as well.  WebCATS (http://www.libdex.com/) is an index of over 18,000 libraries'' catalogs.  You can browse them by geographical location or search the index by keyword.  Each entry provides a direct link to the library''s online holdings.</p><p>2.   Interlibrary Loan (ILL)</p><p>Some libraries partner up with others and form groups called consortia.  These consortia provide access to one another''s holdings - this is where ILL comes in.  When you search your library''s catalog, most likely you''re simultaneously searching the catalogs of your library''s consortia as well.  These libraries include not only university libraries, but also public, school, government, corporate, and institutional libraries.  If you find a resource that isn''t available at your "home" library, you can either borrow it or obtain a copy from the library that houses it.</p><p>Many libraries offer this service online, but if you have any questions or are unable to locate an online form, it can be done at your library''s reference desk as well.  If you aren''t affiliated with a library (or if you need a resource that belongs to a library that your own library isn''t associated with), you might be able to borrow or order it for a fee.</p><p>3.   Academic Databases</p><p>Academic databases are privately owned or proprietary databases that charge users a fee to search their holdings or retrieve full-text documents.  While members of the public can pay to use these services online, students have ready access to dozens of proprietary databases that their libraries subscribe to.  These academic databases can cover a wide range of subjects, from business to the humanities, and offer everything from citations and abstracts to full-text documents.  A single company may produce several different databases, and different databases may include some of the same materials (including journals, articles, or even smaller or more specific databases).</p><p>Before you can choose the right database, you need to have a general idea of what subject you''ll be researching.  Then, browse your library''s site for a database that covers your desired topic. Most likely, you''ll have several promising databases from which to select.  Don''t be discouraged, and don''t rely on just one - try them all out!  Although some of their coverage may overlap, you''ll probably be able to find unique resources in each of them.</p><p>While students veer towards databases, especially those that provide instant access to full-text articles, this is a grave mistake.  As expansive as they may be, academic databases don''t usually include books, dissertations, or multimedia materials.  Their coverage generally only dates back to the 1970s, and they don''t provide exhaustive coverage of most disciplines.  Even worse, the full-text articles sometimes contain mistakes, including typographical errors and omissions of sections of the article - or even the entire article itself!  Ideally, you should supplement your use of full-text databases with databases that only provide citations or abstracts. Then, you can use your library''s online catalog to locate hard copies of the materials.  If the sources you''re interested in aren''t available at your library, it''s very possible that you''re librarian will be able to help you track them down.</p><p>The next time you need to do some research, make the first stop your library as opposed to your laptop!  Far from being supplanted by the Digital Age, libraries have integrated new technologies into their services, making them more useful than ever.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Copyright Kelly Garbato, 2005 <BR>\r Kelly Garbato is an author, ePublisher, and small business owner.

Do they offer scheduling that fits your lifestyle?<br>\r Take into account your lifestyle. Do you have a family? When will you go to work? Many programs offer day, evening and online courses to help you fit school into your life.</p><p>2.  Do they offer job search assistance and/or career planning for students and graduates?<br>\r Does the school offer resources to help you find a job once you have graduated? Do they offer assessment testing to help you determine the best possible career paths for your talents?</p><p>3.  Do they offer professional certifications or memberships?<br>\r Certain jobs require you to have professional certifications in order to become employable. Other professions, such as technical writing, are greatly benefited from the professional associations such as STA. Many professional associations offer discounts and benefits for students.</p><p>4.  Do they offer chances to take courses outside of your chosen major/program?<br>\r This is something you might not initially consider; however, you may find as time progresses that you would like to take some courses in something that is not in your specific major or degree program. Sometimes courses taken outside your major can add value to your knowledge base and marketability.</p><p>5.  Do they offer hands-on training or real world work experience?<br>\r Let''s face it; if you are going to be an auto mechanic, you need to work on cars to learn your craft. You''ll want to make sure your school offers such training before you enroll. Does the program require an internship? Internships are not only valuable to your education, but they help give you the real work experience employers seek.</p><p>6.  Cost.<br>\r Aside from the decision to go to school, cost is probably the next major factor you will consider. Cost will help you narrow down the list of possible schools. When looking at cost consider not only the cost of tuition(classes), but the cost of books, housing, food, other expenses such as program fees, materials fees, computer fees and expenses that may be unexpected (and trust me, they happen so it is best to be prepared.)</p><p>7.  Demographics: location of school, size of student body, faculty and reputation<br>\r Location; is the school close to home? Will you have to travel or will you live on campus? Consider the climate; are you prepared to walk through several feet of snow during the winter? How large is a typical class? How many students attend the school? Is the school well known? These are all questions you should answer when choosing the right school. Also consider the following: What sorts of resources are available to students? Is there a library on campus? Are the faculty members accessible? Do you like the campus?</p><p>8.  Transportation--can you get there?<br> \r This may seem a bit silly to some people, but it is a real concern. School is a major commitment and investment in time and money. You may be involved in group projects where members count on you to show up to class and meetings outside of school. How will you get to school? Will you rely on public transit; busses, trains, subways, or do you have a personal auto? Consider cost such as bus or train fare and gas prices as well as how much time it takes to commute to and from campus.</p><p>Remember this is just a basic list of questions to begin your search.

One of the most well-known, University of Phoenix, started in 1976 with 8 students. Currently, its academic enrollment numbers more than 200,000 students located all over the world, making it the largest private, accredited university of the distance learning colleges. \r In fact, it''s the largest private accredited university in the United States, period. Over 100,000 of those students are enrolled strictly in the online distance learning programs.</p><p>Distance learning colleges are flourishing for a number of reasons. There is our fast changing economy. People need to stay up to date on their skills, or constantly acquire new one''s so that they can advance in their career and stay valuable to their employer, without becoming obsolete.</p><p>There are also many people who feel education is a lifelong pursuit and not something that stops once you graduate from college. Both of these lead into one of the biggest reasons for the popularity of distance learning education and that is convenience.</p><p>We all lead very hectic lives and the one thing we always seem to be short of is time. Distance learning colleges eliminate the time aspect of education as much as it can be eliminated.</p><p>Continuing your education through distance learning eliminates a lot of the hassles of night school. You don''t have to work all day and then drive to class, spend three hours of your evening, drive home, and then study. You can just log on to your computer when you get home instead. This is a much less stressful way to pursue a degree.\r Another advantage is not going through the hassle and stress of finding the right classes, in the right order, that are available at a time that is at least somewhat convenient for you.</p><p>What happens when a class you need is only available Tuesday evenings from 6 - 9 and that''s the one night of the week that you travel for your job. You''re out of luck. But attending college or graduate school through distance learning gets rid of that obstacle.  You can get an online degree instead.</p><p>Another big obstacle in the way of getting an education is money. There aren''t many of us that can quit work to go back to school full time. With a distance learning program you can get an online degree without giving up your current job. This makes it a heck of a lot easier to pursue your degree when you can keep your current income while you go to school.</p><p>The virtual classroom that is available in most distance learning colleges offers other advantages compared with typical academic settings, and that''s 24-hour access to programs, faculty, and the other students, as well.</p><p>With the large number of distance learning colleges you can choose from today, you can find a degree or certification, or continuing education courses, in almost any subject, from journalism, to an MBA, to a PhD, Law degree, accounting, bachelor''s, engineering, culinary school, investing, real estate, paralegal, medical billing and more.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Rob Thomas is a freelance writer and the webmaster for <a target="_new" href="http://www.a1-online-distance-learning.info">http://www.a1-online-distance-learning.info</a>, where you''ll find more free articles on distance learning and online degrees.

This dissertation help program should comprise several elements. The first element is the organizing of your dissertation. Start thinking how your project can be organized, what it should comprise, what structure should it have. At this stage you may turn to the writing guides (online guides and printed ones). They contain useful, tips and advices on the method of completion of your dissertation. Scroll through them, study them thoroughly and decide what method fits best your instruction and your requirements. Despite the fact that many of these advices are really useful ones and dissertation projects have many features in common, yet nevertheless do not forget that different institutions have their own , individual requirements to the scope of the dissertation, the method of the research and format in which the dissertation should be presented. That is why it is indispensable to consult your advisor during this process, and online guides should be used as the guide only, not as the established and accepted way of presenting of your information.</p><p>The second element is to make acquaintance with other dissertations. Try to study them and answer the following questions:  Why they have been written this way? Why this approach has been used?

Dissertation writing (http://www.dissertationsexperts.com/dissertation_writing.php) differs in many respects from the writing of other writing assignments, in term of its scope, its importance and general requirements set by educational institutions. Besides the thorough investigation of the problem, one should produce the thesis-indispensable elements of dissertation writing. The thesis should comprise major points of your contention as well as provide sufficient information on why the problem chosen is worth the researching and what question have been answered by your research. Do not forget that unlike in other writing assignments, your research should contribute to the existing knowledge of the problem and should also have some practical implications for the science in general and the subject you research in particular. The best way during this process is to stick to the plan devised by you and your advisor and write and complete the paper according to it.

Preparing early and knowing what to prepare for can make a big difference.', '<p>Students packing for a trip to another country are often confused - I know I was. It''s not hard to wonder how on earth you''ll manage to have everything you''ll need. After all, you won''t know anyone where you''re going, or even speak the language most times.</p><p>While no advice or tidbit of information can truly prepare someone to spend time in another country, there is some advice to be had. Most importantly, prepare early! Items like passports and vaccinations are extremely important, and may take a long time to get.</p><p>Of course, the only way to know exactly which visas and vaccinations you''ll need is to do some reading about the place you''re going. This reading can also help you prepare for customs requirements for your return trip - everyone likes to bring home gifts and it''s important not to buy something that could cause problems when you try to bring it back home.</p><p>Familiarizing yourself with the travel requirements, though, isn''t the only learning you''ll need to do. Each country has its own weather, culture, and expectations of travelers. It''s important to have some idea of what to expect when you step off the plane. However, remember that reading other peoples'' accounts can only go so far in preparing you for your own experiences!</p><p>Finally, the best advice I was given: Pack less clothing than you think you''ll need. You will almost certainly buy more clothes while you''re in the country. You''ll also want to remember that clothes, souvenirs, and gifts for family and friends back home take up space, so packing with some extra room in your suitcases is a good idea. I managed to pack an extra bag inside my suitcase, so when it came time for the trip home I had plenty of extra space.

The voice over the intercom told me in fluent Spanish just how unprepared I was for the journey I was about to embark on, convincing me of what I already felt I knew. My three years of college Spanish were not going to prepare me for a semester in the Republic of Panama.</p><p>My training in Spanish had earned me a minor, any my LonelyPlanet guide book assured me that English was spoken nearly as widely as Spanish, though I was fairly sure it was overstating just a tad. My school would be in English, but I hadn''t yet been assigned a dorm, nor did I know anyone who would be attending. I was leaving everything and everyone I knew behind for four months.</p><p>Getting off the plane was worse. Passing through customs was something I''d never done in my own language, let alone one I didn''t know. Still, I was excited. Here was my chance to truly learn this new language. Signs were like those I was used to from home, only the Spanish was listed first instead of in the fine print. This I could get used to! As long as I could make it through Customs.</p><p>To my very flustered relief, I found that the customs officials didn''t need to speak to me at all, so long as I had filled out all the paperwork, so I went to grab my suitcase and pass on through. A metal detector later, and I was free to go out into the terminal and was hit by a wall of balmy air that quickly turned quite simply hot as I searched for the face of a program director I''d never seen before.</p><p>She was there, with a glittery sign stating that she was there to pick us up. Apparently there were four of us coming in on the flight from Miami, and one who had arrived on a flight from Costa Rica earlier in the day. "You know, you''re the first person I''ve ever seen to come with only one suitcase!" she exclaimed. I tried to bite back panic, "Well, I packed another one inside." She agreed that it was, in fact, a good idea, and suggested I go wait with my Costa Rican compatriot, and I did. "He''s got a surf board," she said, "You''ll see him."</p><p>It wasn''t much of a stretch to believe he''d be easy to find. This was by far the smallest airport I''d seen, except for the small municipal airport near my home. And find him I did, without much of a stretch. We chatted while the other girls met up with our leader, then we loaded into an old white van, which we would quickly learn to love as a main mode of transit for any kind of group trip, and the same style vans were used as buses for cross-country travel, though this van''s life had certainly seen a lot less action than those.</p><p>This was the beginning of an experience like no other, where I learned a bit more Spanish than I ever thought I''d know. I made friends I never thought I''d have. And I created a history I can never forget. The hardest part was stepping off of that plane. The rest? The rest is history.</p><p>Of course, that''s what everyone says. And when I was getting onto that plane, all I wanted was to hear more than those trite words of encouragement. If I heard one more person tell me it was the "time of their life" or an "unforgettable experience" I thought I might scream.</p><p>I wanted someone to tell me how things went, how they met new people, and the things they saw. It''s just that those other parts are so hard to detail out. You meet new people in much the same way you meet all new people, but the only bond you may find you have with the people on the program is that you''re all in it together. Often, that can prove to be enough.</p><p>Things work out, and you all work together. One of my most memorable experiences was trying with the help of 3 girls and a Spanish-English electronic translator to explain where we were going. We must have found the only cabbie in the whole city that didn''t know where we were trying to go, but we got there eventually.</p><p>I can''t say that there was any one thing that made this such a unique experience, but the top thing I remember is that we all had to work together to get where we were going. That''s the kind of thing that can help to create bonds and friendships and truly bring people together.</p><p>So, if you want to know what all the buzz is about, you''ll have to jump in and give it a try for yourself. Any experiences you have will be uniquely yours, and you''ll never lose them. Why not give it a go?</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Jennifer Smith writes for several travel websites, and spent a semester studying in the Republic of Panama and finishing a degree in writing at Florida State University.</p><!--UdmComment-->');

Of course, with every opportunity comes a challenge - and in this case, the challenge is to find financing for your, or your employer''s, projects.</p><p>With the advent of digital equipment the scope of film & video production has widened. The usual Hollywood styled film production is no longer the only route to a career for film graduates. There are a multitude of opportunities in audio and visual applications throughout business, government and the entertainment industry. That means OPPORTUNITY for the keenest graduates to produce their own film & video projects, or to land the most interesting positions with leading film & video production companies.</p><p>Financing has been a dirty word for years in the film industry. The ''Blue Suits'' and the cold heart of the banker are synonymous with the enemy of the creative. However, in this new era of opportunity you need to be both the ''Blue Suit'' and the creative.</p><p>How do you find a way to learn about film financing, film budgeting, etc.? First let''s look at Film Studies programs.</p><p>There are so many Film Study programs available now that I find it confusing, and I''ve worked in the film industry for over 20 years. The Universities are taking a Liberal Arts degree approach to their curriculums, and the Colleges/Schools are primarily taking a hands-on technical approach. In either case, it is unarguable that Film Studies is big business. The following excerpt from The New York Times Company, published \r March 6, 2005©, made it clear to me how big a business Film Studies really is:</p><p>"Some 600 colleges and universities in the United States offer programs in film studies or related subjects, a number that has grown steadily over the years…. At the University of Southern California, whose School of Cinema-Television is the nation''s oldest film school (established in 1929), fully half of the university''s 16,500 undergraduate students take at least one cinema/ television class."</p><p>Which College, School or University will best prepare the graduate for a career in film & video? If a student has invested 2 to 4 years of their lives in this degree, how can they turn it into a worthwhile career?</p><p>Let''s see what the Universities say about their own programs, and the kind of results they expect - that is, what the Graduate will be capable of when entering the work force. This promotional letter, posted on one University''s web site, says it all:</p><p>"A major in Film Studies is not an occupational or professional degree. A sound program of studies in this discipline, however, should qualify a student for a variety of vocational possibilities. Obviously an individual will need to employ his or her knowledge about film in either a creative or a practical capacity and, in either case, exercise the judgment and initiative that a rigorous pursuit of a major in Film Studies should develop."</p><p>The use of ''should'' twice in three sentences tells the story - it''s up to you, Bud!</p><p>Film Studies programs (at any level) either don''t address, or don''t address strongly enough, the major force behind all film and video production - the MONEY! If the word money is brought up at all, it''s only a handshake and a nod. Most undergraduate programs have very little mention of Film Budgeting, and such things as Cost Reports and Business Plans are treated as foreign topics entirely. The Masters programs are only slightly better.</p><p>The reason for the void of information on such things as Film Budgets, Cost Reports, etc. in the academic sector originates from the big Hollywood production machine. The perpetual negotiations with the three big guilds (SAG, DGA and WGA), as well as with the IATSE & Teamster crew unions has forced the producing studios to be extremely confidential.</p><p>That era of total confidentiality isn''t over, nevertheless there is a huge demand to know more about film financing, film budgeting, etc. The new crop of Independent Film & Video makers want to make their own projects, find their own financing and do their own film budgeting and reporting of production costs. It is even increasingly possible for producers to distribute their own projects over the internet.</p><p>Believe me, the film school graduate who has a thorough understanding of their Film Studies program, AND understands the basic processes of Film Budgeting, Cost Reporting and Business Plans, is light-years ahead of the pack. A film studies graduate who can help prepare a financing package (that is, help to prepare a Film Budget and a simple Business Plan) would absolutely blow away any Independent Film & Video Production company. Can you imagine an Independent Producer who wouldn''t LOVE to have help with preparing and presenting a financing package?</p><p>I used to assume that the film students had a lack of interest in Film Budgeting and Costs (of any kind). Not anymore. I recently did a survey of film students at a respected film school. Here are the results of the survey:</p><p>Over 80% of the students said they felt it was important to know more about budgeting and how it affected their careers as filmmakers.</p><p>Film & Video production is one of the biggest industries in THE WORLD (next to weapon manufacturing, of course). The wide spread use of digital medium has created a new opportunity. That opportunity, although less expensive than the Hollywood style film productions we''ve grown used to, is still costly and requires financing. How do you get that financing? Where do you start?</p><p>Answer: You start with the basics of Film Budgeting, Cost Reporting and very simple Business Plans. If you can calculate a focal point, or learn how to operate a video camera, a Film Budget is a piece of cake.</p><p>Based on my experience over the past 20 years in the film industry, I can confidently say:</p><p>1. Graduates from Film Study programs who know the basics of film & video production money (Budgeting, Cost Reporting and Business Plans) will find they can take on more responsibility in their film & video projects, and</p><p>2. as a result will have more successful careers than their peers who haven''t learned to prepare Film Budgets, who don''t understand any production''s Cost Report and who never saw a simple Business Plan.</p><p>So how does a film student get familiar with Budgets, Cost Reports and a simple Business Plan? I''ve been a Production Auditor for 20 years and I''ve NEVER shown a crewmember a Final Budget or a Weekly Cost Report (the universally standard financial report card issued to the Financiers and Producers every week) in that entire time. They are considered sacrosanct by Studio Executives, Producers and Financiers everywhere.</p><p>Well, I''m about to tease you with some relevant articles that will open the door enough to let you walk through.

This trend in distance learning has exploded in popularity, due to the convenience and flexibility of the diverse types of programs offered. However, there is something you should keep in mind when considering which program to apply to and/or attend. That is, make sure the program you select is accredited by the U.S. Department of Education. This is important and beneficial to you for many reasons.</p><p>Schools are granted accreditation by the U.S. Department of Education for meeting or exceeding certain criteria for excellence in quality of education. It is no different if you choose an online program than if you were to go to a traditional college or University. This accreditation falls under two categories: institutional and specialized. Institutional accreditation pertains to the college or University as a whole, where specialized accreditation pertains to the individuals academic programs within the college or University. Accreditation affects the funding that a college or University receives from the Department of Education. The Department of Education does not govern the colleges and Universities that achieve accreditation. Rather, it works with them to make sure they maintain their levels of excellence and assists them in certain ways to advance.</p><p>Choosing an online college or University that has accreditation form the U.S. Department on Education is the most sensible choice. The benefits for you, as a student, are numerous. For example, transferring prior college credits from one accredited college or University to another is easier. Accredited colleges and Universities have agreements with one another to provide smooth transitions for students. Another huge benefit of selecting a U.S. Department of Education accredited college or University is that you will be able to apply for federally funded financial aid in the form of grants, loans, and scholarships. As a student of an online program, you are entitled to financial aid. This obviously makes attending college more affordable, as well as an attainable goal.</p><p>Yet another benefit of attending an online college or University accredited by the U.S. Department of Education is the legitimacy of the degree that you earn. Holding a degree from an accredited institution will be more recognized and accepted by potential employers when applying for jobs. In addition, many professional organizations do not acknowledge degree from colleges and Universities that are not accredited, the implication being that the academic standards at a non-accredited institution are not held at as high a standard.</p><p>There are so-called online colleges and Universities that do not operate within the limits of U.S Department of Education’s guidelines. They essentially take students’ money and award phony degrees to them with little or no regard for academic achievement or mastery. Often, these “schools” do not require a lot coursework and testing on the required subjects. Therefore their graduates are not truly educated in the fields for which they hold “degrees”. These degrees are not held in high esteem, and falling victim to one of these fake schools can make the road to gainful employment very bumpy.</p><p>Online learning has become a legitimate, flexible, and convenient way to earn your degree, and improve your life professionally. If you are considering one of the many online college and University degree programs out there, remember to do your research. Make the benefits of online education worth the hard work you put into it by choosing a college and degree program accredited by the U.S. Department of Education.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Learn the essential information for picking the right online degree course at <a target="_new" href="http://www.higher-education-online.com/department-of-education.html">Department of Education</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

While going online has propelled the University to the popularity that it enjoys today, it still retains its brick and mortar roots. Describing a University of Phoenix campus is a bit of a misnomer, because there is no single campus.</p><p>The University operates on three educational platforms, ground, FlexNet, and Online.  Students studying through the ground or FlexNet mode take a number of their classes at one of the many University of Phoenix classrooms located throughout the US and even the world.</p><p>As the largest private university, Phoenix has 170 brick and mortar campuses located throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico.  While over half of the school’s 230,000 strong student body studies purely online, over 100,000 attend at least some of their classes at the brick and mortar campuses.</p><p>These campuses are in many cities located in industrial parks.  While this image doesn’t conjure up the grassy quads many envision when they think of the college life, their location is normally based on population density and accessibility.  As a consequence, Phoenix campuses, although not always beautiful, are certainly accessible.</p><p>While the University of Phoenix is famed for its wide variety of courses and degree options, it is less widely known that only certain campuses offer specific degrees.

While Phoenix employs a sophisticated oversight system to ensure that the level of teaching is relatively constant throughout its 170 campuses, that does not eliminate all dispersion.  For example, students have stated that its Texas campuses offer a very high quality education in health, due to the strength of teachers and administrators at that campus.

You don’t have a professor or fellow classmates pushing you so you need to motivate yourself. Can you do this?</p><p><b>What is the quality of the school and program you’re interested in?</b></p><p>The online degree option has a bit of a stigma attached because they are a relatively new learning option and many people might not fully understand how they are delivered. Plus, if you’ve ever received a spam email advertising an online degree (I received two such emails this week alone) you might be turned off by a product that advertises by spamming.</p><p>Like anything else in life, there are good and bad options so the key is to find a school and program that is well-regarded. Long-distance education isn’t new but delivering it over the Internet is.</p><p>Long-distance education is simply just a different option for people to consider and an online degree is simply using the latest technology to deliver it.</p><p><b>Do you require flexibility in order to complete a degree?</b></p><p>If you have a family, attending classes during the day or evening might not be an option for you. Therefore, the flexibility that an online education offers you could be the option you need to continue your education but still keep the other parts of your life organized.</p><p><b>Are you already working and can’t take the time off to complete a degree?</b></p><p>If you are already working and can’t quit your job, the option of an online degree can be very tempting since you can often structure things so that you continue working as usual but complete your degree in your own time. You can’t beat that!</p><p><b>Are you happy to work at your own pace?</b></p><p>One of the benefits that an online degree affords is something that will be very attractive to people that prefer to work to their own timetable and don’t like the structure that traditional classroom learning dictates.</p><p>Some people might prefer to work to deadlines set by other people to keep them motivated and on track but pursuing an online degree enables you to finish your work at your own pace for the most part.</p><p>One of the things that people often complain about – especially after they’ve left school – is the rigidity of traditional educational outlets ie. going to classes at certain times, completing assignments by certain dates, traveling to and from school, etc.</p><p>Some people simply get used to working to more flexible schedules once they get into the work world and find that the thought of going back to school to pursue a traditional education defined by schedules that they didn’t set up is difficult to imagine.

Frankel', 'Make sure that your college experience is more than just getting degree.  Learn 4 reasons why every college student should study abroad...', '<p>The benefits of studying abroad cannot be underestimated.  There is no downside to studying abroad and the upside is huge. From learning a new language to gaining a better understanding of world politics, studying abroad can make you a far more desirable hire to potential employers.  If the person interviewing you also studied abroad, it can be the key to making that connection with them that sets you apart from the others.</p><p>Here are four things that you will learn abroad that will set you apart from your classmates who don''t study overseas.</p><p><b>1.  You will learn and understand a new culture</b></p><p>Doing business with someone is always tricky, but doing it with a person or company in a different country is even more difficult. In some cultures, people say exactly what they are thinking.  For instance, if you went abroad to a meeting and someone said, "John, nice to see you.  You look much fatter than the last time I saw you," as an American you would be greatly offended.  However, if you understood the culture and knew that the comment was meant as an observation and not an insult, it would be easier to laugh off.  Without an understanding of that culture, the whole business relationship could be ruined.</p><p><b>2.  You will have a better understand of foreign politics </b></p><p>Not only will you gain a better understanding of the general politics of a country, but you''ll understand the bureaucracy as well. If your company needs to get something done overseas and you know how to work through the system, you will be that much more valuable to your employer.</p><p><b>3.  You will learn a new language faster than taking a class</b></p><p>Your average language class meets for 45 hours per semester.  Your average day abroad involves 16 hours per day of immersion in a new language.  So, in 3 days abroad you hear and are immersed in a language more than you are in a class for an entire semester!  It is also much easier to learn a language when it is being used in normal day-to-day situations.  Sure, you can learn the basics by reading a textbook or listening to a teacher, but nothing will make you understand a language better than being immersed in it.</p><p><b>4.  You will learn to be flexible and patient</b></p><p>The two things that everyone who studies abroad learns to master are flexibility and patience.  Not everyone in the world eats dinner at 6pm, or has hot water all day long, or has a dryer.  So, you learn to adapt and be flexible in your new situation.  Part of this adaptation involves a fairly high level of patience, as in the U.S. you would probably be pretty upset if you didn''t have hot water! Employees who are flexible and patient are a blessing to every boss.  There''s nothing a manager hates more than an employee who can''t easily switch gears or sit back and wait.</p><p>Remember that studying abroad not only increases your value as a potential asset to your future employers, but expands your view on the world as well.

This well established professional organization can help ensure that you have safest, unforgettable yet affordable study abroad experience.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Lee Frankel is Director of Academic Studies Abroad, a study abroad provider with programs in five different countries.

Is this something you really want to do?”</p><p>Over the last few years, there has been a lot of scepticism surrounding the true value of MBAs once inside an organisation. As the first term of my MBA programme comes to a close, and I begin to look forward to a week absent of work and full of long Mediterranean dinners and hot evenings, I can’t help reflect as I sit in class now on the validity of all the scepticism. First of all, I am sympathetic to the cynics. For a long time I was a cynic myself of the validity of MBAs – after all, they are usually twenty-somethings like myself who think they know all the answers based on what has to be a fairly limited amount of real, practical experience.</p><p>From my experience on this MBA programme here at the BI in Oslo, the scepticism is not unjustified but it is misplaced.</p><p>When I chose to study an MBA, it was predominantly for the intellectual process of reasoning and studying that I wanted to do it. Unlike some, for me graduating in the top ten of the class is not an all-consuming goal – it is rather the acquisition of knowledge and the opportunity to be back in one of my favourite places, the classroom, again that are the pivotal reasons I am studying for this degree. It seems I am part of a minority, however. I may be fortunate in not finding the task of getting high grades overly demanding and actually enjoying the process of studying, but putting it diplomatically, there are certainly a number of less than congenial individuals on the programme who are clearly studying an MBA for one sole purpose: because they can’t rise any higher in their careers without one. The problem with these individuals is that studying an MBA is not what they need: what they need is a lesson in how to get on with people. Most of the types I am speaking about ironically have quite outstanding qualifications already; it is certainly not for lack of academic kudos that they have encountered a limit to how far they can rise within their respective organisations.</p><p>The problem is in the classification of “MBA’s” as a general categorical statement. It is immediately evident on this programme at least that those who are going to climb the ladder in an organisational context would do so anyway, without an MBA. All the programme does is to sharpen the intellectual process so that those who have been “winging” subjects like accounting for the past four years, like myself, can now talk about it with a sense of meaning. On the other hand, an MBA won’t teach those who have a personality disorder how to acquire a personality. Ironically, it is these students who are the most “grade” focused, and who therefore immediately, at least, come across as the most ambitious: because they have found themselves in the unenviable position of having to be. However, once these individuals assume management positions, they quickly find themselves at square one.</p><p>Management is more of an intuitive process than an intellectual one. The problem with studying an MBA for the students who are doing it with the sole purpose of advancing their careers in mind is that, while being somewhat more intuitive perhaps than most degrees, it is still predominantly an intellectual pursuit. MBA’s are great degrees, they are just being used for the wrong purpose.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Daniel M.

Many of us, of course, have jobs and find that the traditional schedules offered by community colleges and universities often make it impossible for us to juggle our schedules to attend. Or perhaps we have family members, kids more than likely, that we simply must dedicate our time to. These are the very things that are making online college courses ever so more attractive. And don''t think for a second that the colleges and universities across the country aren''t recognizing this and responding in kind.</p><p>A great alternative for the person who desires to attend college classes is to go the route of an online accredited degree. This is a degree from a college or university with accreditation, which means it meets the state''s guidelines and is deemed to be every bit as credible as a brick-and-mortar earned degree.</p><p>The programs offered in the form of online degrees very greatly. It is advised that anyone pursuing this avenue of higher learning do their homework and learn as much as they possibly can before making their decision as to which classes to pursue. There is ample information to be had, so by all means request as much as you feel is necessary to obtain the information that you''re after. We must remember that there are so many degrees offered through the online accreditation process that your choices are becoming ever more diversified. Degree levels include Associates, Bachelors, Masters and Doctorates.</p><p>The advantages to getting an online degree are virtually endless. You do not have to commute and there is no need to schedule classes and reshuffle your life around someone else''s schedule. The only thing you really have to do is be on yourself to stay disciplined to get your work done.</p><p>I will again repeat what I said earlier because of its great importance. It is absolutely paramount that you make sure that the degree that you are pursuing and the classes that you are taking are indeed accredited. There''s nothing worse than wasting your time and money taking classes that you will not get credit for, unless of course you are doing it for your own edification.</p><p>If you were ever considering getting a degree to improve your chances of landing a job, or getting paid more, or even to perhaps change careers completely, now is the time to do it. The future is promised to no one and now with the advantages of online accredited degrees, there really is no excuse for not pursuing these wonderful opportunities. Most of these online classes are delivered by way of computer. Don''t be intimidated by this if you are not computer savvy.

Below, we’ll discuss some of the various topics and areas of study that are available.</p><p>By attending film school you can familiarize yourself with international cinema and learn about acclaimed filmmakers from around the world. By adding study of international filmmaking, you can expand upon other film theory classes. After all, the best way to build a foundation from which to explore your own creativity is to study the methods and techniques of the filmmakers that came before you.</p><p>And of course, any good film school will acquaint you with the basics of shooting and lighting techniques and theory. Even a cursory glance at descriptions of how commonly used effects are achieved can bring whole new depths and flair to your own approach to filmmaking.</p><p>If you want to learn a full spectrum of filmmaking fundamentals in as little time as possible so that you can get right down to making and producing your own films, then it would be in your best interest to attend a film school that covers the planning, budgeting and production processes of filmmaking.</p><p>Many film schools also offer post-production courses that are most appropriate for anyone interested in producing their own films. Especially if you plan to work with digital media, you should take advantage of courses offering tutorials on using computer applications that allow you to edit and mix sound and video. Since the innovation of digital video cameras, filmmaking and post-production work has become affordable for everyone. Before digital video, every fade in or out, every effect that could be applied to a film necessarily involved the duplication of the film material itself, such that production often involves working with hundreds of strips of film that must be carefully organized and tracked.</p><p>Even if you’re more interested in becoming part of Hollywood caliber filmmaking, in terms of budget and star power, you shouldn’t necessarily overlook the smaller film schools. While a degree from a known traditional university will get you in many doors, your own merit and achievements are what will determine your success. For this reason it is most important to choose a school that fits your individual needs and learning style.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>For more information and tips about different film schools or advice about acting, please visit <a target="_new" href="http://www.my-filmschool.info">http://www.my-filmschool.info</a></p><p>Charlotte Alice advices <a target="_new" href="http://www.ukdropshippingguide.co.uk">http://www.ukdropshippingguide.co.uk</a> and <a target="_new" href="http://www.onlinewebpublisher.com">http://www.onlinewebpublisher.com</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

Some degrees drop in value more than others, and a few are just downright worthless from the start.', '<p>Face it. There is a great chance that your four year degree will lose its value in the job market.  As more students graduate with degrees, the value of the degree drops. Some degrees drop in value more than others, and a few are just downright worthless from the start. It isn’t surprising to me that those students who major in Accounting or Nursing find it less difficult getting “real jobs.”  However, I’m puzzled by bright students who major in Creative Writing and don’t understand why they are answering telephones at mortgage companies after graduation.</p><p>Who is to blame? The great professor who convinced “you” to major in Philosophy? The academic adviser who told “you” to major in Music?  These are terrific majors, but they don’t necessarily lead to jobs that allow you to get your own apartment and buy your own car.  Sure, you need to find a major that you enjoy, but you need to be realistic. Good jobs are not as easy to find as you think. A college degree may prepare folks for many different things, but it mostly prepares people to enter the job market. Sooner or later, you realize half of the people you must compete with have degrees too, and they have loads of work experience, sophisticated skills, and all kinds of marketable qualities. Employers can cherrypick from a crowd of old and new talent. I don’t want you to think that your future is not bright. There is always light at the end of the tunnel, but that light could be a train.</p><p>So what do you do if you are completing a degree and you think it won’t necessarily lead to a job?  What do you do if you have a degree and you want a better job? You have to acquire the skills that the job market rewards people for having. Here are five examples of what I mean:</p><p>Example #1: 	Learn a foreign language.</p><p>Globalization has brought nations closer together. Most people know that being able to speak a foreign language is an enormous asset. Spanish, French, and German are popular languages to study, and they are found in most college curricula. However, there is a strong demand for people who can speak Japanese, Chinese, or Arabic. Whether you select Spanish or Chinese, the best way to learn a foreign language is to live in a country where the language is spoken. If you can’t move, then you should surround yourself with people who speak the language.</p><p>Example #2: 	Learn to do something unique with computers.</p><p>Though the technology bubble burst, people with computer expertise are still very attractive to employers. Anybody can send emails, but most people cannot design webpages, troubleshoot, or master the latest computer software. Having at least one strong computer-related skill besides word processing can easily set you apart from the crowd. Sometimes, learning from a local computer wizard is much better than taking a college course.</p><p>Example #3: 	Learn how to communicate</p><p>Being a good communicator is more than learning how to write well and speak clearly. Communication is both an act and an art. Different audiences have different needs, and you will have to communicate messages in different ways. You might think a course or two in speech or composition will do the trick. Maybe. I recommend an acting class and a good technical writing course that emphasizes proposal writing.</p><p>Example #4: 	Learn how to sale</p><p>We live in a service economy. While more and more items are being made in countries where labor is cheap, selling still takes place at home. Basically, selling is figuring out how to create a demand for supply. Most students flock to marketing courses, but I would recommend a course or two in Psychology, so you can figure out what actually makes people tick. However, nothing teaches you how to sell like experience selling. I recommend that students start by volunteering in political campaigns. They provide powerful learning experiences in the art of selling and great networking opportunities.</p><p>Example #5:    Learn how to be an entrepreneur</p><p>After acquiring some of the skills that I outlined above, you should consider starting a small business.  There are continuing education courses and tons of books that can show you how your hobby, talent, skill, or expertise has value beyond an employer. The tax breaks and extra income are great incentives. Plus, your business might boom and make you a nice nest egg. Your savings can help you weather the storm after your boss suddenly decides that your wonderful skills are no longer enough to keep you on the payroll.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>J.K.

What to consider when choosing an academic major.', '<p>So you’ve picked a school (college or technical) but what are you going to study? \r I’ve compiled a list of things to consider when choosing an academic major.</p><p><b>Level of interest:</b> Do you enjoy the subject? You are more likely to be successful if you enjoy your major. If it bores you, you will likely be unmotivated and may suffer academically.</p><p><b>Do you have a natural talent/skill? </b> Don’t discount any natural talents or skills, instead, let those skills guide you to success.</p><p><b>Possible careers? </b> What sort of job will your degree prepare you for? Will you need additional schooling to achieve your career goals? Is your major geared toward one particular trade (for example; engineering or accounting) or can you apply it to many careers (Majors such as English, history, psychology that teach marketable, non-trade specific skills such as reasoning, critical thinking, writing and communication)?</p><p><b>What are the requirements? </b> What courses and how many will you have to take within the major as well as supplementary courses outside your major (i.e. accounting students take courses in marketing, economics, and business as well as specific accounting courses). Does the program require a minimum GPA for admission and retention? Will you need a minor? Will you be required to complete an internship or a co-op program?</p><p><b>Prerequisites. </b> Are there specific courses you must complete prior to engaging in major specific courses? (Prerequisites are often lower level introductory courses that establish a basic set of knowledge that will be referred to and built upon in subsequent classes.) For example if you wanted to major in psychology you would most likely be required to take a course introducing theories, models and major researchers in the field.</p><p><b>Evaluate the instructors. </b> How qualified are the teachers? Where did they go to school, what sort of degrees do they hold, where have they previously worked or taught and what have they published? Find out about reputations from other students as well. Is a certain professor notorious for being rigid or difficult? A good relationship with an instructor can benefit you when you begin applying to graduate schools or jobs and you need recommendations.</p><p><b>Program reputation. </b> Does the program receive national attention? What do graduates think of the program? What sort of jobs do alumni hold?</p><p><b>Are you considering a double major? </b> A double major can be a huge undertaking. This can be fruitful but you will need to be more organized when planning class schedules and picking classes. Some majors will not allow you the time to devote to a second major (often called comprehensive majors.) Be informed and be prepared to work!</p><p><b>Check out survey and introductory courses in a variety of programs. </b> These courses will be more general and give you a better understanding of what to expect from the program as a whole. Remember, you probably are not going to like every single class or topic in your major. I had a friend who loved cost accounting but hated her tax accounting class.</p><p><b>Browse the course catalog. </b> Familiarize yourself with the policies and requirements. Read the school’s handbook regarding the differences in requirements for an Associate’s Degree, a Bachelor’s of Arts, Bachelor’s of Science, Bachelor’s of Fine Arts, etc. These will each require a different set of courses. Also, check your school’s general education requirements. These are often a set core of courses every student must take in order to earn their degree. Check for overlaps and conflicts with your major. Some departments won’t give credit for certain courses in a major that were used for general education requirements.</p><p><b>Use your advisor. </b> These people know the ropes. They are there to help you navigate the system. If all of this is overwhelming (and don’t feel bad if it is) relax! If you have an advisor who just isn’t helping you, see if your school has a set of general advisors set up for undecided students. These counselors will often have access to information about general school topics (deadlines, procedures) as well as tools to help you find information regarding specific degree programs. If you already have a major but are unsatisfied with your advisor, consider asking for a reassignment. Often this can be done in the department office.</p><p><b>Talk to other students. </b> They can often provide insight and experience that will be beneficial. An upperclassman can be your best friend when it comes to figuring out the system. Not only do they know the best places to eat, but they might know the best places to buy and sell books, the best advisors and the best teachers.</p><p>Don’t be afraid to change your mind. In the long run it’s better to spend an extra year or two in college than to be miserable or regret your decisions. People change their majors all the time (I changed mine 3 times.) and while it’s a big decision, it is only a piece of the larger puzzle.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Kate Leas is a freelance writer living in Kansas City, Missouri.

Many people may tell that you should have one chosen by the time you start your first year. Unless you’re absolutely 100% sure of your career path, you don’t need to worry about making that decision just yet. Keep your options open. The actual deadline for choosing a major is the end of your sophomore year.

I thought I would never figure out what I wanted to do or what I was good at. I had originally come to school wanting to be a political science major. Then halfway through, I decided that politics was something that I didn’t want to be a part of (for various reasons). Next, I wanted to be a psychology major. I loved the class so much that I decided to declare. Eventually I got bored with psychology and switched to history. I love history and I’m completely fascinated with it. I soon lost interest with being a history major and became an English major. I figured since I love to read and write that this would be perfect. That ended up being a little too much reading and writing for my taste. Plus, I had to take classes like ‘Eighteenth Century British Literature’, which I ended up sleeping in. So I remained undeclared until the Spring Semester of my sophomore year.\r That semester, I signed up for a video production class. I excelled in the class.

Well quite literally it is one who studies forever. You might say that everyone is in fact an eternal student. But I am referring to that type of person who is a permanent resident in a university. The perks of staying in college are numerous-- namely you don''t have to pay for your life. Some of the lucky are able to con parents into paying for their stay at institutes of higher education, but one can occasionally trick the government and other scholarship organizations into paying. There are several types of eternal students ranging from the truly dedicated to the wild partier.</p><p>Most often when one refers to an eternal student the automatic assumption is that of the Truly Dedicated Eternal Student. This is often a student who has chosen random and rather bizarre course work. You most often find these students among Classical Studies or History students. The reason is simple. No one cares about those majors except the people in them. Who really needs to major in Sanskrit anymore? It''s a five thousand year old dead language. So students of these types of majors can always find something old to study and claim the need to study that fully before they move into "the real world".</p><p>These students can always find something else to study because the stuff has been around so darn long. Since no one cares about these studies anymore these students are free to hide is the sunlight-deprived coroners of dusty libraries and remain free from responsibility. The major difficulty in being a truly Dedicated Eternal Student is to lie convincingly enough so that the parents, friends, the university, and financial supporters all believe that the student needs to remain ensconced in their studies.</p><p>The Multiple Degrees Eternal Student is a nefarious schemer. This student is the only eternal student to ever actually earn a degree. And not only do they earn one degree, but they earn several. The primary goal of this type of student is to have more letters after their name than in their name. They will earn a BA and a BS and an MA, MS, MPH, JD, MBA, MD, PhD, DrPH, and on and on and on. In some ways this Eternal Student is the most talented and most conniving of all Eternal Students.</p><p>Not only must they posses the intelligence and talent for earning these many degrees but they must convince others that they actually need these degrees. The danger, however, in being a Multiple Degrees eternal student is that, unlike other eternal students, these individuals have actually completed acceptable levels of education. At some point their financial support will revolt due to the immense financial burden these multiple degrees impose and the student is generally told to go ahead and utilize their degrees. The best counterattack to this type of difficulty is to be educated out of any possible job and so, after a brief interval, return to higher education.</p><p>Another study bound eternal student is the Cutting Edge Eternal Student. These students study material on the cutting edge of technology. Often the world assumes these are the students who are first to venture from the confines of college life. In this the world is sorely mistaken. Most major advances in technology are made by doddering old men and women who made the mistake of leaving college and have been trying to keep up ever since. True there are your Walt Disney’s and Bill Gate, the rare examples of young people achieving great technological successes. But those individuals are few and far between. The Cutting Edge Eternal Student insists on learning the latest new technology before entering the workforce, so as to be “well prepared”. Cleverly enough, by the time they finish learning the last skill there will be new material to be studied.</p><p>The only problem with study bound eternal students is that they almost always have enough or more than enough credits to complete their degree. Parents or government officials who notice this often require the said student to graduate, putting an end to their free ride. The Multiple Minors Eternal Student manages to dodge these questions of graduation by never achieving enough credits to qualify as a major in any given subject. These students cleverly craft their schedules so as to always be without the correct requirements at the appropriate time to have continuous course study.</p><p>Because of these "scheduling mistakes" the students must then take alternate classes where they "discover" new interests and the same scheduling problem arises. The most common excuse from such students is that they are using college to "expand their horizons". Despite appearing to have a lack of foresight these students are very conscientious of timing in courses. The only difficulty with The Multiple Minor Eternal Student is that after a period of fifteen or so years lines of study become restricted. So these students can most often be found petitioning for new majors and can be thanked for many of the more curious majors found in colleges today.</p><p>The Lack of Core Eternal Student is another student who fails to meet the prerequisites of graduation. These students do, however, study all the course work required of their major(s). These students refrain from graduating by failing to meet certain prerequisites of the core curriculum. They are different from The Multiple Minors Eternal Student is that their goal is to receive all credits BUT the core course whereas The Multiple Minor Eternal Student''s goal is to meet ONLY the core course requirements. Obviously The Lack of Core Eternal Student can only be found at schools with a core curriculum, preferably an extensive one. The difficulty with this method of study is that the student must work hard in their major to counter the effects of their "failed" core courses in order to not be kicked out of the school. These students are most easily found supporting the need for a "liberal arts education"; also know as a ridiculously extensive and hardly useful core class requirement.</p><p>The Eternal Transfer Student also manages their education so as to avoid gaining any real credit form a given school. Often these students take a "leave of absence" to "explore" other schools. In that way they fool the schools that they attend into not giving them credit while still remaining in the college lifestyle. The Eternal Transfer Student must be very astute like The Multiple Minors Eternal Student and plan the course and schools they attend.</p><p>If they are very good they can successfully fail to obtain a degree from dozens of universities. The key to this failure is choosing courses at a given school that do not transfer to another as anything more than elective credit. A subset of the Eternal Transfer Student is the Eternal Study Abroad Student, who is merely a transfer student of foreign universities. This specialized Eternal Transfer Student is slightly more difficult to maintain, due to the immense expense of foreign travel. Another common pitfall of the Study Abroad Student is to unwisely fall in love with a foreign city or person and to permanently move abroad, therefore putting to end their “studies”.</p><p>The last and most infamous Eternal Student is simply called The Eternal Party Animal. The name speaks for itself. These students are the students who always manage to miss class because they are sleeping off a hangover. These students require very gullible PARENTS. The government cannot be conned into supporting The Party Animal''s habits for long. The most common fault among The Party Animal Students is carelessness. They are so busy partying they fail to pass enough classes to remain in school. Therefore a smart Party Animal will only attend a school that is easy and abundant with fraternities and sororities. Schools that provide that atmosphere are more likely to be lenient towards The Party Animal and let him or her thrive. The Greek System is also very supportive of the Party Animal in providing instant friends, abundant booze, and term papers. A warning to those considering The Party Animal life: most former Party Animals die of depression, cirrhosis, or venereal diseases.</p><p>The privilege of Eternal Studentdom is not to be taken lightly. At no other point in your life is it a) acceptable that you not know what you are doing b) normal for people to give you excessive amounts of money and c) expected that you will do dumb things. If you doubt what I say is true just look at all the adults trying to go back to college- it can''t be done.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Sarah Boutwell received her undergraduate in Biology from the University of Chicago and is currently pursuing a Master''s of Science of Public Health.

An easier way to obtain an edge in the working world is by getting that online college degree that you’ve always wanted, without having to leave the comfort of your own home. All of this may very well be true, but there are a few things that a person should consider before becoming financially tethered to an online college or university.</p><p>Can you make the time?<br>\r Take a moment and evaluate how much free time you really have in your personal life. After tending to your work, house chores, possibly children, and making time just to relax, how much time do you have left to study and work on assignments? This involves hours reading which can be very time consuming.</p><p>How comfortable is “the comfort of your own home”?<br>\r Do you have the peace and quiet necessary to read and study? Are the people in your house (spouse, children, friends, etc.) willing to give you the time and space you need? More times than none, this is the biggest problem. Everyone around you might not be willing to put there life on hold for your betterment. This is a hard reality, but when you are at home, people will be tempted to confront you with home issues that will interfere with your studies. If you were in a classroom setting, this would not be a problem. Unless you are one of those individuals you can’t turn their cell phone off.</p><p>How credible is the online college degree you are pursuing?<br>\r There are now several online colleges to choose from, but how credible are they once earned? Will the college degree earned online hold any weight in the working world, or did I just put all this time and effort into a worthless piece of paper? You may want to research via online bulletin boards or websites. Even word of mouth to some extent. It’s not my place to tell you which online college is worthy, but rather to advise you to take the time to see if the college you select will get you the job that you want.</p><p>Can I afford the loan to get my education?<br>\r Certain online universities have government loan programs set up where you don’t have to pay back your loan if you complete your schooling. These sound great in theory, but what if you don’t complete your schooling and have to pay it back? They are usually very expensive and here’s the catch: Once you get the loan, the school gets paid in full. So they get their money no matter what, and you get stuck paying the government back the remainder of your loan for nothing in return. The online colleges are making a fortune off students under these circumstances. From information I gathered off of different online studies, the freshman dropout rate is over 25% higher for online students. The overall dropout rate is nearly equal that number.</p><p>What are the “pros” to online college degree courses?<br>\r Under most circumstances, people who say they don’t have the time to attend traditional college classes do so mainly because of family issues. Children involved and no sitter available. Unfortunately like I said earlier, the children can make it difficult to concentrate at home. I am not trying to discourage any parent in getting further education, but trying to prevent them in finding themselves in a hard financial situation because they couldn’t make it work for them. More than half the time, if you don’t have time to go to classes, you probably won’t have time to do them at home either. There have been many parents as well as other individuals who have made this work successfully though. These are just things to consider. A big convenience for most to online class is not having to partake in the social aspect of college. If you are an aging adult, sitting in class with pimple faced kids can be annoying. It can also be distracting hearing about all the parties and other gatherings that take place at school. If you have any health issues that make it difficult to leave the house, online college is a fantastic option.</p><p>I hope this knowledge has helped some of you in your decision making process. I have been fortunate enough to have an insider’s look at online colleges classes and ultimately I believe any education is good education. Your knowledge is the one thing nobody can take from you, I just want you to be sure that your newly acquired knowledge can be put to good use and benefit you and your future.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Timothy D.

Is your field of interest so specific that course offerings can be found at only large colleges and universities, or do you place more importance on the accessibility of faculty to the student body? How important is the size of the college''s library? All of these factors should be considered when finding a college. \r <br>\r <br>* Housing - Will you be commuting from home, or living away from home? If you were living away from home, what housing opportunities would best suit you? If you interested in dorm life, does the college have adequate on-campus housing, or is there a waiting list? If you''re more likely to live off-campus, is there a housing shortage in the community? What is the going rate for apartments, and how does that fit into your budget?\r <br>\r <br>* Cost - Although there are a myriad of financial aid options available to students who qualify academically, cost is certain a consideration when finding a college.

Do a little research into the benefits of studying in this historic and exciting city, and you may find yourself wondering why you would study anywhere else.</p><p>There are many colleges and universities in Florence, so you will have a wide range of choices as to which institute of learning you would like to attend. No matter what your course of study, you will probably have little trouble finding a college that can cater to your curricular needs. If your goal is to attend college in Italy specifically because you are studying the language, Florence has several institutes that specialize in teaching Italian to foreigners. They are geared not only toward teaching the base language, but also the history of the Italian language and the subtle differences in dialect in the different regions. Learning to speak the language while immersing yourself in the rich culture of Florence is an experience few Italian-language students would want to miss.</p><p>Those who are studying art, art history, or music can find ample reason to consider attending a college or university in Florence. The city is so steeped in art and music culture, both historically and present-day, that students cannot help but find their studies considerably enriched.  Florence has retained so much from the Italian Medieval and Renaissance periods that students will be able to study firsthand what elsewhere they could only read about and look at in books.</p><p>Business, economics, cooking; all of these things can be studied in Florence, and many of the colleges work closely with institutes in America to coordinate a seamless and beneficial learning experience for foreign students studying abroad.</p><p>Besides the educational benefits of studying abroad in Florence, Italy, living in the city for a decent period of time can be enlightening, enriching, and will provide memories that will last a lifetime. Many who study in Florence return to visit again and again – the magic of the region stays in the heart and is not easily forgotten. Art galleries and artisan shops abound, and visitors can spend months just immersing themselves in the rich artistic atmosphere. Many of the buildings from the Medieval and Renaissance periods have been lovingly preserved and maintained, and the architectural splendor of these monuments to Italian history is something everyone should experience at least once in their lives. The restaurants with their authentic and delicious cuisine along with the small local shops strewn about the city add to the atmosphere that makes falling in love with Florence even easier.</p><p>Florence is a province of the Tuscany region, one of the most beautiful areas in Italy and, arguably, the world. Tuscany’s acres of olive tree groves and vineyards are a beautiful sight to behold while traveling through the rolling green hills of this breathtakingly beautiful region. When students have a little time off from their studies, the Mediterranean ocean provides opportunities for fishing, boating, sailing, or just enjoying the relaxing coastal atmosphere.</p><p>Don’t just consider studying abroad in Florence; do it.

It is a program that helps to supplement the cost of education and offers opportunities to those who otherwise may not have the means to further their education.</p><p>The first step to receiving financial aid is to filling out the free application for federal student aid. This is the agency that determines what the family contribution should be.

There are some programs that are based on merit or are non-need based and can replace expected contributions from a family source.</p><p>By applying early, several funding sources for assistance can be considered.

She came from\r a divorced family where neither parent had gone to college.  She didn''t know much about how the system worked.</p><p>Of course, she went through all the workshops her high school''s guidance department offered. she listened to all the returning graduates coming back for Thanksgiving vacation.</p><p>She got lots of stories about what was a good college experience and what should be "do-overs".</p><p>Allison was a good student...a B average.  Her S.A.T. scores were also pretty good...just over 1000.  She had lots of options.</p><p>So what should Allison do?</p><p>Allison didn''t care much about the size of the school she went to, but she wanted it in a large metropolitan area.  Since she lived about two hours from New York City, she thought that might be nice.</p><p>She also thought she might like to major in business, since she didn''t particularly enjoy science or math and she liked the business side of her job at a sit-down restaurant.</p><p>Beyond that, Allison didn''t give the college search process much thought until November of her senior year.</p><p>Big mistake.</p><p>As I''m sure you know from term papers, the closer you get to something''s due date, the more nervous you get about doing it, and the more you become willing to settle for any old choice, so long as you''re doing SOMETHING!</p><p>So one day Allison got a letter from a really nice college in the NYC area that specialized in business degrees.  A good college...nothing wrong with it.</p><p>It also cost $28,000 a year.  Is that a good investment?</p><p>Sure it is...if a college has EXACTLY what you''re looking for.

Since it was not a very selective college, she got in easily.</p><p>And they gave her a SCHOLARSHIP!  $1500!</p><p>Great...now she only had $26,500 per year to pay.</p><p>Despite the pleas of her guidance counselor and the misgivings of her mom, she decided this was the college for her.</p><p>She applied for financial aid, got another couple\r of thousand in grants, got the standard student loan for a first year college student, and had her Mom take out loans for the remainder of one semester''s tuition.</p><p>Allison really enjoyed her one semester at this college...got good grades and felt like she really fit into the community.</p><p>So it was really hard to say good-bye after half a year because her mother decided she didn''t have the tuition for the second semester.</p><p>Allison wound up going to community college for the spring semester, and transferred to a state university in her home state.  She''s now a junior majoring in accounting.</p><p>She enjoys her "new college" and looks forward to moving to the Big Apple when she graduates.</p><p>Of course, she and her mom are still paying off the loans from her one semester at Big Price Tag U.</p><p>Am I saying that expensive universities are a mistake?</p><p>NO.</p><p>Let''s look at what Allison did wrong.</p><p>1.  She started the college search process late, so she made decisions under pressure.</p><p>2.  She didn''t look at enough schools.  Someone had a really nice picture of a really nice school on a really nice letter, so she said "yes" to the first place that looked good.</p><p>3.  She didn''t look at the big picture.

Hoffman', 'Getting a degree in the fifties wasn''t as easy as it looked.', '<p>In the country side where I grew up, a high school student''s greatest goal was to work the farm  like his dad, get married and have lots of little farmers.   Sixteen of us graduated from high school, not including two boys that had to leave in April for spring planting and one girl who got  married.  One girl and one boy (myself) succeeded in going to college.</p><p>My grandparents were (relatively) rich  but  my parents had little money, certainly not enough to send me to college.  I loved  science and after winning the Bauch and Lomb Science Award, I wanted to be a physicist.  My mother read in the newspaper that the S.A.T.s were to be held in a movie theater in the next town, the three top scorers in the state qualifying for State Scholarships.  Our high school was perhaps one of the smallest in the state, borrowing most of their teachers from  nearby Pennsylvania.  In spite of lacking courses in calculus, logic, and higher mathematics, I braved the test anyway.  Three weeks later the announcement arrived that I had won the third place spot in the state and would be able to attend Rutgers University,  tuition free!  After all the jumping and celebrating, we planned how I could afford the room, board, and books.</p><p>A spot opened on the cafeteria staff of the sister college, Douglas University for Women, providing me with room and board money.  I was to serve the college girls coffee and hot chocolate from six thirty until eight AM every week day.  Used books were available from the local book store in town.  The only fly in the ointment was the Physics class, my major.  At the end of the year, I was called into the Dean''s office and informed that my grade in Physics was too low (though passing) to retain my scholarship and I would have to pay tuition the second year.  I pleaded that since the physics building was located a mile away, the classes were shortened to forty minutes.  I just didn''t have enough time to complete the two semester theory tests in time.  My professor asked us to solve three theories.  I solved one and  completed the second but ran out of time for the third theory.  I was just too slow. Calculators would have helped, but they weren''t invented yet.   These  sixty six per cent  grades  brought down my fours in the  rest of the tests.  I was successful in ROTC training, entering a weapons handling contest and winning first place handily.  I also joined the track team and went on field trips with the  Rutgers Photographic Club.</p><p>Well, the Dean gave me another chance, if I would agree to go to summer school for advanced mathematics.  I also changed my major to Geology, but Physics was still a requirement.  The summer school was held in some old World War II Quansett huts, the temperature rising to one hundred degrees in the afternoon.  I also found time for photographing children which insured the cost of my books for my Sophomore year.  My worst fears were realized when I read my courses the next year.  They duplicated my Freshman year courses: Scientific German II, American History II and Physics II.  All featured the same professors.  The physics classes were held in the same temporary building as last year (the new one was being built) and the same interview with the Dean resulted.  But this time it was final.  No scholarship.</p><p>Back at home, a talk with my dad revealed that my education was last on his list (his words) and grandma would not donate one penny much less four thousand dollars.  And this for her oldest grandson who was named (middle names of Charles Virgil) after her husband and great grandfather.  She said that they wouldn''t dare touch the principle, since they still had two homes to support and the country club and all.  Now don''t get the idea that I am at all bitter about this fiasco, just disappointed that I didn''t get to finish.

Lastly, Phoenix University structures their programs in a concentrated manner so that you can finish your education in a timely manner despite having to work around a work schedule.<br><br>\r Perhaps the best reason for you as a busy adult to consider Phoenix University is that many of their programs are designed around working adults.

These classes are sometimes self-pacing, but even the ones that are not will offer you the flexibility to log in and do the lessons within blocks of days. You can log on to your class in the evening, morning, or even on your lunch break. Whether it is evening and weekend classes or online classes that you choose, you will be able to fit a full college schedule around your work day with Phoenix University.<br><br>\r Secondly, with Phoenix University the programs are concentrated in nature. By taking classes that are a little more concentrated with a slightly heavier workload you can finish your degree much quicker. Despite having to work around your busy professional life, you will still finish many degrees more quickly than you would at a traditional college or university. You do have to be diligent and driven in your desire to continue or gain your education, but if you are you can certainly finish faster than you normally might. Phoenix University, in that way offers you a great opportunity and thus is worth a look.<br><br>\r Third, you should consider Phoenix University because of the prices.

The reasonable pricing and varying plans as well as the acceptance of most financial aid means that you can actually afford to go back to school as well.<br><br>\r It is an admiral thing to want to continue your education.

Online you are likely to find a number of places where you can get an accounting degree online. Online education for any degree is great if you are someone with a busy schedule. By getting your accounting degree online you can work on your education at night, on weekends, or whenever you have time. Just check to make sure that whatever online institution you choose to go with is accredited for accounting.<br><br>\r The next place you can look for an accounting degree as at your local university or community college. Many of these higher education facilities can offer you a wonderful accounting degree. A community college is especially a place where you might have a great educational experience on your way to that accounting degree. Community colleges often offer the same night and weekend options that would also be fulfilled by the online class. If you don''t think you would get as much from your accounting degree if it was obtained online, then perhaps a community college would be your best bet.<br><br>\r If, though, you like the idea of a more traditional accounting degree, then a local university might be the way for you to go. You will get an accounting degree that is likely accredited and from someplace a little more recognizable to the public at large. You will also be able to attend college in a more traditional manner more easily if that is your desire. In the end, it is just a matter of your personal preference if a traditional local university is the best place for you to obtain your accounting degree.<br><br>\r Lastly, when all else fails, check with local institutes of higher education to see if they offer correspondence classes. Correspondence classes are those taken through the mail. If you don''t have internet access, time to get to a campus, or a community college nearby, correspondence courses may be the best way for you to get your accounting degree.<br><br>\r Getting your accounting degree is probably very important to you. It can open a lot of career doors for you and will get you doing what you really want to do. Where, though, can you go to get your accounting degree? There are a number of places you can look to get your degree in different ways. Check online to see if you can get your accounting degree over the internet. Go through the local higher education establishments and see if you can find a program that you think will work for you. Then, if all else fails, you can always investigate a correspondence course to get your accounting degree. No matter how you do it, though, just make sure it is the best program for you and your situation.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>If you would like to view more of my articles on <a target="_new" href="http://www.ad-accountingdegree-tips.info">accounting school</a>, please feel free to visit my <a target="_new" href="http://www.ade-accountingdegree-tips.info">accounting careers</a> website!</p><!--UdmComment-->');

Many students are unaware of how to save money on the tuition for college degrees.  This lack of knowledge about tuition assistance means that a significant number of students end up paying more for their college degrees than they should have to pay.</p><p>Many students are aware of scholarship, grants, and student loans as methods for reducing the cost of college degrees.  Student loans are effective, as long as you understand that you have to pay back the loan and you find a well-paying job to help you make your student loan payments each month. Scholarships and grants can be more useful, as you usually do not have to pay them back.  However, there can be difficulties if you obtain partial scholarships for your tuition.  Some schools offering college degrees will set aside how much in financial aid you can receive in total.  If you receive scholarships, they will take that amount out of your total.  So your financial aid amount will not go up unless you obtain more in scholarship money.  If this is the case, there are other options still available to pay for college degrees.</p><p>If you are young and willing, the military is a great way to pay for college degrees.  The Reserve Officers Training Corp, or ROTC, offers scholarships that pay for college education.  The ROTC scholarships will pay for a significant portion of your college education a long as you serve on active duty in the military upon graduation.  If you are willing to serve, college degrees qualify participants for officer status.  Veterans are also eligible to pay for their college education via the G.I. Bill.  Military Academies also allow you to obtain college degrees for free while earning a monthly stipend.</p><p>Besides the military, another way of paying for college degrees involves taking certain exams to earn credits.  CLEP exams and the GRE test will enable you to test out of taking specific classes.  If you do not have to take the classes, then the cost of college degrees goes down.  Besides the cost of college degrees going down, it will also allow you to obtain your education faster.  The small cost of taking each test will save you significant amounts of money on college degrees.</p><p>A third option in paying for college degrees involves taking less expensive classes at one school and transferring them to another university.  Since the tuition for college degrees varies from school to school, you can easily take basic or pre-requisite courses at one school for less money.  Many students find that taking the basic courses required for college degrees at a community college saves them significantly in the end.

It is essential to plan carefully to select the right school for your child.', '<p><b>Choosing a School Abroad</b></p><p>A major cause of concern for families moving abroad is the provision of education for their children. Many worry that schools in the destination country may not be able to offer the same standard of education that has previously been available in the country of citizenship. Research is vital prior to any move abroad in order to make the best decision for your family.</p><p>Many countries around the world, particularly those with a high proportion of expatriates, have a number of international schools which use familiar models of education such as American, British or other systems. These schools generally follow the curriculum of their chosen model and teach in their native language.  A growing number of international schools follow the International Baccalaureate which is accepted as an entrance for university around the world. International Schools tend to be located in the major cities of the world, although a few are located in green spaces and these tend to offer boarding as an alternative to a long journey from home to school. Most good international schools offer a wide range of extra-curricular activities that broaden your child’s education as well as providing new interests and hobbies.</p><p>As well as the international school option, it may also be possible to enroll your child into a local bilingual school. The advantages of this would be that your child will quickly develop new language skills and would better assimilate into the local community. A downside however would be that the bilingual school would most probably follow a different system than your child is used to and there may be problems reintegrating back into schools at home or universities. An international school would be a safer choice, although these do tend to be more expensive than bilingual schools. Whilst a school may describe itself as an International School, it is important to check out the nationalities of the students on role as some international schools can have a student population comprising almost entirely of local students. In these situations overseas students can often feel isolated and unable to join in with the rest of the school community.</p><p><b>Careful Planning</b></p><p>Before enrolling your child in any school abroad, make a visit to the school and determine if the school offers the best for your child.

Knowing how to establish your parameters and search efficiently can make the process easier and will lead to \r better results in a shorter period of time.</p><p>Graduate School Search Made Easy:<br>\r Know your objectives – The first step to finding the right program through a graduate school search is to write down exactly what you want from a graduate program.  Location, internship eligibilities, highly regarded instructors – \r decide which factors are most important and create a list of priorities.</p><p>Consult an online graduate school search guide – Before you can narrow down your selection, you’ll want to get as much information as possible on many diverse graduate programs.  Using an online search program can help you to get a lot of information in a short amount of time.  Request information packages from at least 10 different programs to provide a variety of options.  Further research may provide some portunities that you wouldn’t have been aware of prior to your graduate school search.</p><p>Narrow your options – Once you have obtained the information from the various schools you contacted via the graduate school search guide, you can perform a comparison based on your initial objectives.  Select the top three or four programs that best match your graduate school preferences.</p><p>Contact existing students – Now that you have a smaller pool of options, consider contacting current students participating in the program you wish to join.  Most schools will be happy to put you in contact with a student who can answer your questions about the program’s courses, instructors and overall value.</p><p>Visit the campus – Along with making telephone or internet contact with the schools you are considering, your graduate school search should include a trip to the campus itself.  Unless you are considering the prospect of online or distance learning, getting a feel for the physical environment can play an important role in your final decision.</p><p>Re-evaluate your choices – Once your have a more personal view of each graduate program, take a minute to compare your field of choices once more.</p><p>Now that you have additional information, it may be possible to eliminate some of the programs from your graduate school search.  If you have a clear front-runner, it may be that you have already found the school of your choice.</p><p>Sleep on it awhile – Whether or not you believe you have found the right graduate school program, take a little time before making your final decision.</p><p>Choosing a school will affect your life significantly and you don’t want to be impulsive about it.

Many of us, of course, have jobs and find that the traditional schedules offered by community colleges and universities often make it impossible for us to juggle our schedules to attend. Or perhaps we have family members, kids more than likely, that we simply must dedicate our time to. These are the very things that are making online college courses ever so more attractive. And don''t think for a second that the colleges and universities across the country aren''t recognizing this and responding in kind.</p><p>A great alternative for the person who desires to attend college classes is to go the route of an online accredited degree. This is a degree from a college or university with accreditation, which means it meets the state''s guidelines and is deemed to be every bit as credible as a brick-and-mortar earned degree.</p><p>The programs offered in the form of online degrees very greatly. It is advised that anyone pursuing this avenue of higher learning do their homework and learn as much as they possibly can before making their decision as to which classes to pursue. There is ample information to be had, so by all means request as much as you feel is necessary to obtain the information that you''re after. We must remember that there are so many degrees offered through the online accreditation process that your choices are becoming ever more diversified. Degree levels include Associates, Bachelors, Masters and Doctorates.</p><p>The advantages to getting an online degree are virtually endless. You do not have to commute and there is no need to schedule classes and reshuffle your life around someone else''s schedule. The only thing you really have to do is be on yourself to stay disciplined to get your work done.</p><p>I will again repeat what I said earlier because of its great importance. It is absolutely paramount that you make sure that the degree that you are pursuing and the classes that you are taking are indeed accredited. There''s nothing worse than wasting your time and money taking classes that you will not get credit for, unless of course you are doing it for your own edification.</p><p>If you were ever considering getting a degree to improve your chances of landing a job, or getting paid more, or even to perhaps change careers completely, now is the time to do it. The future is promised to no one and now with the advantages of online accredited degrees, there really is no excuse for not pursuing these wonderful opportunities.

Aside from the traditional scholarships offered to those who are blessed with the diligence to live life with their faces in books, or the grace and athleticism of a gazelle, there is also a plethora of scholarships for those of us who are darn proud of what we do but don’t quite make it too the coveted over-achiever status.</p><p>Many of us have heard the stories of the friend of a friend who didn’t have to pay a dime for their education simply because they were left handed or happened to measure in over 6’ 2”. And though these tales seem too good to be true, rest assured there is nothing fabricated about it (honestly, who could make this stuff up?) and these types of financial backing may be more available than you realize. Whether you pride yourself on your duck call or you think your um, unique fashion sense combined with your passion for duck tape merits a little assistance from a third party, look around and it’s likely to be out there. Some of the more strange scholarships we found include everything from an apple pie baking contest (first prize gets $25,000 to the Culinary Institute of America’s) to one that encourages young minds to study the Klingon language; naturally this one is given by the Klingon Language Institute.</p><p>Certain celebrities can also at times be counted on to share their own wealth such as the interest David Letterman is known for displaying through his scholarship fund awarded for outstanding creativity. Search far and wide and you’re sure to find a group that wants to support you just for being you, or maybe even just because they had supported your grandmother through school! But a word to the wise, before counting all your eggs or putting all your chickens in one basket take the time to make sure your benefactor is legitimate. Be aware of groups who request to remain anonymous (even from you) or are making outlandish requests from you in return for their so-called generosity. And finally, when it comes to applying to scholarships don’t be afraid to be greedy. Apply for as many as you are interested in and you may be surprised as to how much money your future is worth to other people.</p><p>If the scholarship route isn’t for you there are other ways of paying for school on your own (and I don’t mean that in a creepy meet-me-behind-the-student-union-next-Thursday-at-3-a.m. kind of way). There are plenty of financial institutions out there that are more than happy to help the struggling fledglings out there with enticingly low interest rates, long repayment terms, and flexible application deadlines. Student loans can be taken out for as little as $1,000 or as much as $50.000 with the option to defer payments on the principal for up to six months after graduation. And better yet they can usually be obtained from any banking establishment where you are a current account holder as well as any number of organizations which exist specifically for the purpose of helping you get through this (expensive) phase of life. Some of the top name student loan companies include Sallie Mae, Nellie Mae, and Educaid each having several different payment plans for both graduate and undergrad students.</p><p>The morale of the story kids, being asked to pay for your own education is a huge obstacle but it doesn’t have to be an insurmountable one.

Thinking about an online school.  Get the skinny on college life for an adult.', '<p>College, College, College. The ongoing debate on whether you need a degree or not to succeed in today’s world. Let me digress a bit here and fill you in on my career decision. I was a so-so student in High school, graduated basically a "C" student and almost repeated my junior hear for failing Algebra. I hated school, couldn''t stand it. When the Navy recruiter called me, I jumped at the chance to get right into the work force with no college. College was the last thing on my mind. Even with a free ride from the folks, I still didn''t want anything to do with it. After being in the Navy for about 6 years or so, I decided I needed a degree to further my professional development. I enrolled at Columbia College of Missouri as a part time student at a distance Ed. branch in Washington State. The Navy through Tuition Assistance paid for 75% of the class tuition. I covered the other 25%, that''s all changed now and the Navy now pays 100%. Through many night classes, CLEP tests and online classes I graduated Cum Laude from Columbia in 2002. I chose to major in Criminal Justice and a minor in Education.</p><p>Now the Navy has implemented that in order to promote to certain ranks, you will be required to have a degree of varying levels. Currently I''m working on my Master''s Degree in Theology. I know your thinking; I go from criminal justice and education major to theology. Just goes to show you that a person’s interests change over the years. I''m attending Andersonville Seminary right now, still on active duty and 60% complete.\r Now I''ve had plenty of experience in various types of school efforts. Here''s what I''ve learned.</p><p>First-Go to college when someone else will pay for it. Whether it''s a scholarship, parents, grant, military etc. If someone else will foot the bill, take them up on it.</p><p>Second-Internet and online courses are convenient, but with that convenience comes increased difficulty. It''s much harder to collaborate with schoolmates; you must set specific time aside each day to dedicate to your class. It''s really easy to put things off till the end of the week, then you produce lackluster work.</p><p>Third-Correspondence classes are even more difficult, mainly because you spend so much time waiting for work to come in or go out via mail. Many now use and accept email submissions, but some still use the old tear-out workbooks.</p><p>Fourth-Pick a reputable school. Many degree farms churn out a worthless piece of paper with your name on it for about $1,000 dollars. You''re only cheating yourself. Any employer will be able to determine quickly if your degree is accredited or not. There are College Recruiters  out there that can make your school search easier.</p><p>Lastly-Don''t wait till someone requires you to get a degree for some reason before you start working on it. By that time it''s too late, someone already has your promotion.\r Bottom line is with only about 28% of America with College degrees, there is definitely room for more college grads.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Provided by Casey of <a target="_new" href="http://www.TheCheevesFactor.com">http://www.TheCheevesFactor.com</a/>.</p><!--UdmComment-->');

They don’t recognizing that it’s a full-time job.</p><p>Recreation: There is no curfew and students living in dorms can be of drinking age, so alcohol is readily available. Many teenagers on their own for the first time are sorely tempted by the sense of freedom for experimentation.</p><p>Knowing ahead of time about potential problem areas allows parents to help their college-bound children get better prepared. Making good decisions is obviously not something one takes a crash course to learn how to do. It is the habit of a lifetime, and as parents, we begin to teach our children to make good decisions by allowing them sufficient independence while they are still at home and directly under our care.</p><p>The freshmen who were tightly restricted at home, and never encouraged to think for themselves, are generally the ones who go wildest as freshman. They’ve been given a taste of freedom they weren’t ready to handle.</p><p>If a parent thinks that a graduate needs more time and maturity before going to college, it is wise to give that time. It isn’t necessary to go straight from high school to college.

In the end, it didn''t turn out that way. They say hindsight is 20/20, so I am here to share my experience so you may gain from it. Here is a list of what to do when transferring colleges', '<p>At the beginning of my senior year in high school, I sent off half a dozen college applications and recieved acceptance letters from most. After much thought, I chose to attend the local junior college instead of an out-of-town university. My plan was simple: spend two years earning my associates degree, transfer, spend two more years to finish my bachelors. In the end, it didn''t turn out that way. They say hindsight is 20/20, so I am here to share my experience so you may gain from it. Here is a list of what <b>not</b> to do when transferring colleges:</p><p><b>1. Do NOT put your associates before you bachelors degree</b>\r <blockquote>My first mistake was knowing the graduation requirements for the junior college I attended and paying little attention to the requirements for my transfer college of choice. I spent two and a half years memorizing the graduation checklist to get my associates. When I finally thought to look at what would be expected of me at the university I had applied to for a transfer, I discovered almost a full third of my classes were not going to count towards my major. If I had compared the requirements for both degrees sooner, I could have still earned my associates without wasting those eight classes.</blockquote></p><p><b>2. Do NOT put off your transfer application</b>\r <blockquote>This is perhaps the one mistake I didn''t make. My transfer university promised a response within two months; I applied five months before the start of the quarter. It is always best to apply well ahead of time to give yourself time to breathe and to tackle any roadblocks that might come up. Face it, they happen.</blockquote></p><p><b>3. Do NOT put off sending your transcripts</b>\r <blockquote>This means both college and high school. Some colleges require an associates-level of college credit before they will accept a transfer, others are not as picky. If you do not have the required number of college credits, the transfer school could put a hold on your application to wait for high school transcripts. It is best to send both off, preferably within a few days of filling out your application. If you can, do it the same day. Don''t wait for them to send you a request for your transcripts. You should also keep in mind that in-progress classes will not be counted as college credit. When you finish the semester and your final grades are in, send a second copy of your transcripts to the school or you won''t get credit for the classes you just took.</blockquote></p><p><b>4. Do NOT expect them to contact you</b>\r <blockquote>This isn''t saying they won''t contact you, just don''t wait for them to do it. Read up on their admissions procedure, taking special notice of how long it should take to hear back from them. If you haven''t heard from them within the minimum amount of time, do not hesitate to call the admissions office and ask about the status of your application. Do this frequently until you recieve your acceptence (or rejection) letter. This will enable you to stay on top of any requirements or any holds on your application. Most universities will attempt to contact you if there are problems with your application, but do not depend on it.</blockquote></p><p><b>5. Do NOT wait for your acceptance letter before acting</b>\r <blockquote>Even before I got my acceptance letter, I had purchased a college catalog, made a list of classes I would have to take and when they were offered, contacted the financial aid office, and made contact with staff working under my major. I had also toured the campus with a map in hand, discovered just how bad parking would be, and what would be the best way to get in and out of campus. This meant I was very comfortable with the idea of attending my transfer university, before I''d even registered for my first class!</blockquote></p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Sarah Kurczodyna is an author at <a target="_new" href="http://www.writing.com">http://www.writing.com</a> which is a site for <a target="_new" href="http://www.writing.com">Writers</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

It is usually three or four years of living in rented accommodation, paying university fees, for books, for all your educational needs, and for all your other living expenses, without properly earning anything at all for the entire period.

I consider college education a much more valuable experience than high school because living on campus far away from my family will have very significant impact on my personality. Living on my own will help me assess my personal skills, and ascertain the areas of strength and weakness. I consider on-campus residence opportunity a crucial part of college education because I will get a chance to discover things about myself that I never though I had. There will definitely be pleasant moments as well as hardships but it is the only way to test a person. It is much better to know your weaknesses and strengths rather than staying ignorant of their presence. Even if a person has many weaknesses it is a much better option to discover them and then fight each particular weakness rather than overlooking the drawbacks and shortcomings of one’s personality.</p><p>I consider college education to be of extreme importance because it contributes to the overall process of transformation of a teenager into an adult. Some teenagers never overgrow that stage because they have never been exposed to independent, self-sufficient lifestyle. Always living with parents who care about a person and solve all problems that arise along the way is not always good it terms of their contribution to personal development of a child. Life is difficult and the best way to learn effective strategies and techniques of dealing with future problems and difficulties is to face them with an open mind and open eyes. I am not advocating lack of parental care and support. By no means should you get that impression. On the contrary, a child must be assured that parents are always there to help in case he or she encounters a problem that is too difficult to solve on one’s own. College experience provides that environment where young people can face the realities of life and see if they can deal with their personal problems themselves. I am sure that college education will give me a chance to become an independent and self-sufficient person capable of dealing with everyday life situations. I consider that to be a very important component of college education. Also, I believe that college education will give me an ample opportunity to improve most of my skills and shape my inner world in the sense that I will be able to critically comprehend what goes on in the present-day society and have my personal opinion about various issues. I hope to meet new people from various cultural and social backgrounds who surely have valuable experience to share and different ideas to communicate. I believe that it is through communication with other human-beings that people are able to learn new things and generate original ideas. Those are the things that I expect to get out of college education besides the information that I will learn from the textbooks and informative lectures delivered by experienced professors.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Tim Johnson Junior is a freelance writer, CRWA certified resume writer and career coach.

But a lot of students from US high schools lack the skills and interest to understand the courses taught to them in private technical or vocational colleges.', '<p>Until recently I have taught technology classes including networking, web programming, web design, and others at a private corporate run college. I prefer not to divulge the name at this time. You''ve probably seen their advertisements on national television, since they have many schools scattered all over the United States. My involvement was with their school situated in the Chicago area. This school was mainly filled with high school graduates from Chicago and its suburbs. I want to tell you about some of the problems I experienced with students at this school. Many of the instructors that I''ve worked with as well as others that I know from similar schools had comparable experiences.</p><p>The main reason I''m so opposed to our global corporate culture is because it sets man''s primary goal as financial wealth but pretends that it is some common good. This is why the majority of students choose a private college. One of the school''s sales staff convinces them that they''ll make a lot of money upon graduation. They either may have a mild or no interest in what they need to study. Some have no prior skills in their field of choice. They are told they don''t need to know anything, but they''ll be taught every skill needed for their success. They can afford all this education by taking out a government backed financial loan. The college expects its instructors to open the heads of their students and fill them with knowledge.</p><p>Standardized tests in high schools give the average student the idea that the answer to a question is more important than understanding what the question is about. Students then refuse to be challenged. If the problem takes longer than five minutes to solve, they demand the answer. The words "You gotta give me the answer, cause I''m paying this school thirty-thousand dollars!" seem to echo throughout the halls of private colleges. No instructor has ever withheld an answer to an assignment. Instead the instructor first wants the student to attempt the solution by himself or herself. In so doing, the student develops the most useful part of the educational experience, the problem solving ability. Most of the time the instructor gives helpful hints as the student searches for the answer.</p><p>Students seem to ignore what they''re expected to learn, but they''re constantly concerned about their grade. It''s nice to have a good grade point average, but it''s even nicer to gain a good grasp of what is being taught.</p><p>It looks like TV has had a real effect on today''s student. Because TV watching is a passive event, students expect their education to be passive as well. Students want to sit back and watch while their instructor amuses them. So what students really want is an entertainer instead of a teacher. If they were studying quantum physics, the students of today would prefer an instructor like Jay Leno rather than one like Albert Einstein. When dealing with history, politics, or literature it''s easier for an instructor to develop an entertaining approach, but how can one make a programming class fun? Even if the subject of the program is humorous, the actual programming requires some thinking which today''s students were conditioned to avoid.</p><p>Because students can''t get deeply involved in what their supposed to be learning, they avoid studying and doing their homework as much as possible. In classrooms where computers are available, they use instant messaging to have on line conversations with their friends while the instructor is lecturing. They skip a lot of classes but remain in school so they can graduate and get that high paying job they were promised. To get the students to pass the class, a multiple choice test is given for which they are well rehearsed. Most pass with high marks, but some still fail.</p><p>If you know anything about education, you know that the majority of learning comes from a person''s own efforts. You must do the studying while the school is there to help you as you evolve from confusion to understanding. A school can issue a degree validating that you''ve indeed learned the principles of your chosen field. In today''s competitive world, it''s very hard to find a job without some sort of degree or certificate. Sometimes the high tuition is worth it, if the expected knowledge is really attained.</p><p>Are there students going to private colleges that are highly motivated and are excellent learners? Of course there are. I''ve seen students that are every bit as good if not better than MIT students. But they are in the minority. Some of them did not go to US high schools but graduated from schools in countries like India or Poland.</p><p>American high school graduates are able to master some computer related subjects. Computer and Xbox game playing, instant messaging, email, web surfing, and blogging are their best subjects. Unfortunately, they''re not part of the curriculum. Of the actual subjects taught, about half can do basic HTML and simple networking. Except for the gifted students, virtually no one can really program in any common compiled or scripting language. However, almost everyone passes these classes, sometimes even with high marks.</p><p>If you plan on starting a career in a computer related field here is some advice. Before going to a private college, ask yourself how much you know about what you intend to study. If you know nothing, then go to the internet and try reading about it and doing some tutorials. If this doesn''t interest you, find something that does.</p><p>Invest in a good computer or two (if you want to study networking). Get a DSL or Cable internet connection. If you can''t afford broadband or it''s not available in your area, at least, get a dial-up connection. Look into open source software if proprietary software costs too much. I''ve encountered students taking web design who didn''t have a computer or internet connection, so they couldn''t practice what they were taught or do their assignments at home.</p><p>If you have a hard time learning the basics take some remedial courses at a community college. You might even consider a degree from there. Tuition at community colleges is a lot less than that of private colleges and often they teach the same material.</p><p>Get certification books in your field of interest and find similar material on the internet. If you study hard enough, you can get certified without any formal training. Certification tests usually cost around one hundred dollars. Make sure you''re really prepared so you don''t waste your money. Sometimes having a certification can land you an entry level job better than a degree from a private college.</p><p>Remember, if you want to launch an interesting career, there is no easy way to succeed. You simply have to work hard for it.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>George Lunt is someone who feels the world is getting too corporate.

Do you feel that you are doing busy work and not learning anything? If so you may not be alone in fact everyone in college goes thru this phase. For instance a very bright college student made this statement this week:</p><p>“I can''t tell you how many classes I''ve taken that seemed so remedial but necessary and/or mandatory to take just to get that stupid piece of paper that I have to pay for that proves I''m "smart."</p><p>Indeed I had to leave school for this reason myself.

As a dissertation and tenure coach, I’ve come to realize that everyone in academia, whether writing a dissertation, completing an article, or doing research, struggles with procrastination. Why is this so prevalent in such a well-educated, intelligent population?', '<p><b>You''ve Got the Wrong Attitude</b></p><p>Your belief system is what may be standing in the way. Most academics cling to the belief that they must set aside large chunks of time, do a lot of preparation, and be in the proper frame of mind to be able to write.</p><p>What this means is that when you finally sit down to write, it''s going to be an unpleasant marathon. You have placed such importance on this writing session that you feel anxiety about it living up to your expectations. And you know it''s going to be difficult. After all, there are thorny issues you haven''t addressed, articles you haven''t read or reread, and a lack of coherence to your thinking. You need to solve those problems. And if you don''t do it now you''ll be quite disappointed in yourself.\r How unpleasant! And how counterproductive!</p><p><b>What Should You Believe Instead? Or "Oh, The Irony!"</b></p><p>Research by Robert Boyce actually shows that first and second-year professors who participated in a study on writing productivity were able to turn out more publishable pages in a year by \r <br>·	Writing 30 minutes a day \r <br>·	Only writing on workdays \r <br>·	Shoehorning that writing into small gaps in their busy schedules</p><p>The difficult part, it turns out, was convincing these professors to try this low-key method in the first place. Ironically, they all insisted that the only way to get real work done was to do it in the marathon way that I described above.\r The second irony was that when Boyce actually measured the amount that they were writing per week (before the intervention,) it was less than 30 minutes per week! This was much less than their retrospective reports of how much time they had been spending writing.</p><p>The third irony was that those who most adhered to the idea that you must write in large doses were the least productive.\r The fourth irony was that although these professors considered writing a private activity, they did best when they were accountable to someone for maintaining their 30-minute writing habit.</p><p><b>Do It Already!</b></p><p>So what''s stopping you from learning from these professors and writing a small amount each day?</p><p>Here are typical excuses:\r <br>·	It''s just not rewarding writing in small amounts. I feel like I''ve gotten nothing accomplished. \r <br>·	I have a big issue to work out. It will take more time than 30 minutes. \r <br>·	I feel guilty if I don''t work more each time. \r <br>·	I''ll never complete my dissertation/paper/research project at that pace. \r <br>·	I''ve waited until it''s too late and I can''t afford the luxury of that small amount of time per day. \r <br>·	It just doesn''t feel right. \r <br>·	I''ve got more time than that, I should be putting all my time to good use. \r <br>·	It''s so overwhelming that I don''t know where to start, and by the time I figure it out my 30 minutes will be up.</p><p>My answer to those responses? Bull! Except for the emergency deadline, there is no reason not to try this technique. Give it time to see if it works for you. If you''re like every other academic I''ve worked with, you will resist the idea. I suggest that the more resistant you are, the more problem you''ve probably had with procrastination in the past.</p><p><b>An Action Plan</b></p><p>Try it for a week. Select a time each day, preferably not the evening unless you''re a night owl, and write for 30 minutes, without email, reading or other distractions. Don''t listen to the voices in your head saying you "should be getting more done," or "you should be writing more than this." I''ll bet at the end of the week you''ll be pleasantly surprised at your output, and pleased with the increasing ease with which you can sit down to write.  You’ll start to see progress on your dissertation or article and maybe come to believe that you will finish one day.</p><p>Furthermore, don''t forget about being accountable to someone. Let someone else know that you''re going to be doing daily writing. Perhaps you can find a writing buddy, or someone in your dissertation group.</p><p>Don''t forget, if you always do what you''ve always done, you''ll always get what you''ve always got. Start setting yourself up for success starting right now!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>© Gina Hiatt, PhD. \r Gina is a dissertation and tenure coach.

The aim of this article is to describe the transition of the traditional "essay banks" to what are known as "custom essay sites" and the further progression to "personalised essay sites", and to outline the common grounds under which the use of these services are deemed to be perfectly legitimate and reasonable.', '<p>The traditional essay banks that still exist today are purveyors of pre-written essays that allow students to ramble through them and find an essay that they can use to benefit their studies. There are many problems associated with the use of essay banks, for instance not only do they seldom provide the relevant material to the student, but they are not unique and therefore they fail to culminate the required research for the customer. This means that one would have to spend hours searching the essay banks (often having to purchase the right to view numerous essays) in order to achieve a reasonable amount of research to refer to. Not only is this extremely time consuming, but it could often prove very expensive, with students spending a great deal of time and money only to end up with more than few vague, poor quality essays to help them with their studies.</p><p>The many problems associated with essay banks led to birth of the custom essay sites. These sites set out to solve the problems common to essay banks by providing essays that are written to the customers'' question. This enabled students to purchase a model answer specific to their requirements without having to search the internet for hours. This eventually had its adverse effects on the market, with many custom essay sites using this as an opportunity to use their custom essay service to build up their own essay banks, as well as using their existing essay banks to create custom research from. Customers were essentially buying an often wholly plagiarised piece taken from, or soon to appear on an essay bank. They were essentially paying for a piece of research that would soon benefit other students, therefore taking away any competitive advantages that the model answer would have granted them.</p><p>The next phase was the innovative creation of the "personalised essay service". These services provide a piece of research that is custom written to the exact requirements of the customer, with a guaranteed level such as a guaranteed First Class or 2:1 standard. These essays are scanned for plagiarism, ensuring each piece of work is unique, furthermore they will not appear on an essay bank or database for a fair period of time - 4 years or more, and will never be resold....</p><p>Now for the speculation - are these personalised essay sites aimed to encourage cheating. Having looked at the main websites in this industry, I have examined the grounds under which their service is intended and should be used. Under the FAQ section of one of the main providers, it was fairly argued " Our aim is to produce essays and research materials in order to aid and inspire your topic or subject area. We deliver model answers to the questions that our customers submit to us- that means the research materials that you receive would guarantee a 2:1 or 1st class in a like for like exam. The work that our researchers produce for you is for your own reference, to benefit your final piece, however it is not intended for you to pass off as your own. We rely on our customers to use our service sensibly."  Furthermore, they retain the copyright for all their research pieces and if used sensibly, their service is merely offering substantial support to customers, just as a private tutor would. They do not condone cheating in any form and act to discourage it.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Tanya Scott</p><p>Tanya Scott attended a top university in the UK and has witnessed first-hand the problems experienced by students in meeting their deadlines due to poor research methods.

Students must be able to learn through written words, not audible words. And they must feel comfortable sharing information over the Internet. Students must also believe their education can be learned without ever stepping foot in a traditional classroom setting.</p><p>To determine whether or not online education is right for you, you need to be honest with yourself and ask the following questions?</p><p>Why do you really want to return to college?</p><p>Understanding the real reason for returning to college is vital to your success. If you''re returning to college just to have something to do in the evenings, returning to college is not for you. But if you are returning to college to better your lifestyle, get a raise, advance your career, or set an example for your children, then there''s a 90% chance you''ll not only complete your courses, but get a good education in the process.</p><p>Why do you want to pursue an online education instead of attending a traditional in-person college?</p><p>If you''re a social butterfly who flourishes when others are around, attending an online course (http://www.buy-a-diploma.com) may not be for you. If, on the other hand, you''re quiet and reserved, online education can be your ticket to success.</p><p>"Research indicates that quiet students often thrive in online courses," says Dr. Stella Thompson, an online Assistant Professor of English at Prairie View A&M University. "This environment enables quiet students to consider a response and to compose and revise that response multiple times before making their knowledge public."</p><p>Do you tend to quit a project due to lack of motivation?</p><p>If you can''t stay motivated on your own, an online institution is not your best choice for getting a degree. Attending an online college means you must be self-motivated. You won''t find the professor, or another student reminding you to get to work, stay on task, or turn your assignments in on time.\r "Completing a degree online demonstrates a tremendous commitment and discipline on behalf of the student," says Shari Sterling, Director of Enrollment Management at Northcentral University. "The student must be self-motivated to be successful."</p><p>Do you work better alone or with other people around?</p><p>Can you work in solitude? While you may be networking with other people through the Internet, you won''t see these people face-to-face and that can feel isolating at times.\r Do you need in-person study groups to help you complete assignments and shoot ideas off of, or can you find the same help from Internet interaction? Why does one method work better for you than the other?</p><p>Do you learn better by reading, by listening, or by seeing?</p><p>When you read information, do you comprehend what you''ve read easily or must you read the information several times to understand what is being said? If you find it difficult to comprehend information when read, and learn better through visual or audible techniques, you may want to find a traditional institution.</p><p>Can you write your thoughts down so others understand what points you are conveying?</p><p>Since online courses require the use of written words to ask and answer questions, as well as turning in assignments, you must be comfortable with sharing your ideas in written form.</p><p>How many hours can you devote to learning, studying, and homework?</p><p>You need to set aside time every day to work on your courses. Whether you''re researching, reading, completing an assignment, or meeting your classmates in an online forum, your education needs to have a priority in your busy schedule.</p><p>"Just because you don''t have to attend school at a particular time everyday, doesn''t mean you don''t need a daily or weekly regimen," says Terri Main, an online instructor and teacher of 20 years. Your schedule "may vary from day to today, or simply be spending 30 minutes a day on your education, but it needs to be consistent."</p><p>Does your work require you to travel a lot?</p><p>If you''re constantly away from your home computer, it can be difficult to get your assignments done. However, it''s not impossible. If you travel a lot, you''ll need to invest in a laptop computer and wireless Internet access.</p><p>Do you have a working computer in your home?</p><p>If your computer is over two years old, it could be outdated and unable to handle the demands of attending an online institution. You need to find out what kinds of software programs are needed for the course you plan to take and if your computer has enough RAM, and hard drive space.\r Keep in mind that you can use an older computer, but if it doesn''t have enough memory or space to run a particular program it will stall and freeze, which can be very frustrating and eventually cause you to quit.</p><p>Do you have dial-up Internet access or high-speed cable/DSL?</p><p>The courses you take will determine which Internet access is best. If you have dial-up Internet access, you''ll need to set aside more time for research, uploading, and downloading.</p><p>Do you understand how the Internet works?</p><p>When taking online courses, you''ll need to understand more than just how to log onto the Internet. You''ll need to understand:</p><p>•	how search engines work;<br>\r •	how to send and receive email;<br>\r •	how to attach documents in an email;<br>\r •	how to download programs or documents to your computer;<br>\r •	how to find downloads later, when you need them;<br>\r •	how to use hyperlinks;<br>\r •	how to use chat rooms, message boards, forums, or instant messaging and what the proper etiquette is;<br>\r •	how to protect your private information; and <br>\r •	how to protect your computer from hackers, spam, and viruses.</p><p>Do you know how to cut and paste?</p><p>Sometimes you''ll need to take information you''ve written in one program and put it in another program. This is called "cut and paste." If you don''t know how to do this, find out how before you begin your online education.</p><p>Do you find learning new computer programs easy or hard?</p><p>Depending on the online course you take, you may need to download new software programs. If you find it difficult to learn new computer technology, you''ll need to either set aside more time for learning, or take a traditional class.</p><p>"Online learning can be completely dynamic and engaging!

Now the colleges have the results of your efforts in one college application.  It is time to let go, and let the admissions officers do their jobs. You have done everything you can do, and now you must wait.</p><p>High achievers tend to have the most difficulty with the waiting they \r must endure.  After all, high achieving high school students have \r accomplished their successes by taking control-taking responsibility for \r their schoolwork, immersing themselves in extracurricular activities and \r projects, and maintaining a strong work ethic.  For some, the period after \r one has submitted his or her applications is more stressful than actually \r writing the applications.</p><p>However, others let out a huge sigh of relief after turning in that last \r application.  Finally, you have completed your work and now the \r decisions rest in someone else''s hands!  You can finally study for your \r next test, go out to the movies with your friends, or even watch television \r without that little voice in your head (or perhaps a parent or IvyWise \r counselor) saying you really should be working on your college \r applications.</p><p>But what can you do while you wait?</p><p>One practical thing you can do is update the colleges on your \r accomplishments, should anything new occur since you submitted your \r applications.</p><p>In addition, now is a great time to begin to reflect on your college \r applications and the college search process thus far.   What have you \r learned about yourself?  How have your ideas about what you thought \r you wanted changed?  What did you discover about yourself by \r choosing topics for college essays and spending all that time writing \r about yourself?  What would you change about the college admission \r process if given the chance?   Writing college applications is not just \r about impressing enigmatic admissions officers.  It is also about \r assessing where you have been, where you are, and where you would \r like to go.  Hopefully you have learned something about yourself that \r you will take with you.</p><p>If you find yourself obsessing over your college options during this \r waiting period, there are a few tips that can help you manage your \r stress.  Maintaining healthy eating habits and exercising regularly are \r most important in times of stress.  Healthy eating and regular exercise \r help to mange stress, and are two things you can easily control.  Next, \r you will want to surround yourself with people-family and friends-who \r support you and remind you how great you are, no matter the outcome \r of a college admission decision.  Continue to deal with stress in ways \r that have worked for you in the past-whether you write in a journal, \r spend hours on the phone with a friend, or play an extra game of \r basketball, cope in the ways that you have found work for you.</p><p>If you feel like you only have a few schools on your list that you would be \r happy attending, then you should definitely spend some time continuing \r your research on schools that you applied to but you know less about.  \r This research will help you get excited about many options and prepare \r you for when you are the one who has to decide where you want to go \r to school.</p><p>Another point to remember is that you are still in high school.  Focus on \r your classes, activities, friends, and family.  Take time to relax.  Any \r period of intense work requires time for relaxation and reflection.  \r Learning to take care of yourself physically and psychologically will help \r you adapt to the changes in your life that college will bring.</p><p>Here at IvyWise we have some very impressive admissions statistics.  \r Even so, perhaps the most important statistic to remember during \r stressful times is that 100% of IvyWise students go to college.  You will \r have a fabulous college to attend.  Maybe we don''t yet know what the \r sticker on your car or your new collegiate sweatshirt will say…but we \r know we can wait until we find out.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><!--UdmComment-->');

The college admissions process can be overwhelming, and because it’s constantly evolving (and each school uses different criteria for evaluating admissions!), it would be difficult for anyone to master the process.</p><p>To take some of the guesswork out of admissions, we decided to get the latest on the process from those in the know. Kerry Rosen, Director of Admissions for Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College of Florida Atlantic University, and Susan Hertz, Associate Director, Marketing of American University, shared advice and information for high schoolers preparing to apply to college.</p><p>What is the most common mistake you see applicants make to hurt their chances of getting accepted into a college or university?</p><p>ROSEN: They submit late or incomplete applications, or don’t check to see what is required, such as how many letters, an essay vs. a graded writing sample, etc.</p><p>HERTZ: Or they don’t check to make sure that all the required parts of the application have actually arrived.</p><p>What is the approximate weight given to grades, test scores, extracurricular and community activities, essays and recommendations? What other factors do you like to consider?</p><p>ROSEN: We place a lot of emphasis on the academic record because we offer a very challenging program and we want to be sure that the applicants have what it takes to be successful here. We look at test scores, the strength of the classes taken, grades, and also require a graded writing sample so that we can see the how well the applicant is able to communicate in written form. In addition to academics, we are interested in what the applicant does outside the classroom – school and community involvement, employment experience, honors and awards. Letters from teachers, counselors and people in the community tell us a lot about the student’s character, motivation and level of compassion.</p><p>HERTZ: This information is found in most guidebooks. At AU, we look at grades in conjunction with the difficulty of the courses selected and test scores; essays and recommendations; and then activities.</p><p>Can you give us an example of a few applicants whose grades or test scores were below the average for your admitted students but who were admitted for other reasons?</p><p>ROSEN: We sometimes take a chance on a student with a less than stellar academic record if they have demonstrated an extraordinary level of character or persistence in the face of economic, social or cultural obstacles. Some examples might be a recent immigrant or a student dealing with a very difficult family situation.</p><p>HERTZ: We look for students who show evidence of leadership. Essays also often explain the circumstances that have caused low grades or test scores.</p><p>What can/should high school sophomores be focusing on regarding college?</p><p>ROSEN: Tenth graders should be focusing on learning more about themselves, academically and personally –  about their interests, about their strengths and weaknesses. They should begin to compile a list of the kinds of things they would like to find in a college. From that list they can come up with a list of colleges that meet the criteria they have set. It seems to me that that way they’d be able to find a better fit between themselves and the school.</p><p>HERTZ: They should take a challenging course of study and find an activity that he or she can be passionately engaged in.</p><p>Regarding extracurricular activities in high school, is it better to try a little bit of everything or to excel in one thing? Does it matter what the activity is or is it mainly that they devote meaningful time to it?</p><p>ROSEN: We prefer to see a couple of activities that the student has really gotten involved with. This is much more impressive than a long list of clubs that someone has joined mostly to be able to list them on college applications and resumes. It is especially impressive when a student has either had a leadership role in a school or community organization or they have demonstrated initiative by actually starting a new club or activity.</p><p>HERTZ: Excel in one thing. The activity doesn’t matter.</p><p>To what extent is it better to take honors or AP courses even if the grades are lower? For example, what looks better: an A in regular English or a B in AP or honors English?</p><p>ROSEN: Taking challenging courses is a real benefit. They are great preparation for college work and taking them is worth possibly getting a lower grade.</p><p>HERTZ: For a competitive university such as AU, better to take AP or honors, definitely.</p><p>How important is balance—i.e. sports, academics, volunteer work—in your admissions criteria?</p><p>ROSEN: We like to see applicants who are involved in things other than academics. But it is not a good thing to be so involved that the academic record suffers for it. We sometimes see this happening when a student’s job becomes too demanding and does not leave enough time for studying. Students need to be very careful to achieve the right balance.</p><p>HERTZ: Balance is nice but not a deal breaker, so to speak. We believe that a wide range of “types” creates a dynamic academic experience. Most of our athletes are also scholars; some academically outstanding students do no sports and minimal volunteering.</p><p>What are your policies on Early Admissions and Early Action? What trends are you seeing with these? Do students have a better chance of being admitted under these plans?</p><p>ROSEN: We have a non-binding Early Action deadline of December 15. We do not believe that binding plans are in the best interest of the student. Having an applicant make an irrevocable decision that early in the senior year does not strike me as fair and equitable. Students at age 17 or 18 are still learning too much about themselves and what and where they want to study to make a good choice that early.</p><p>HERTZ: We do Early Decision only. Typically students have about the same chance of being admitted although this can vary tremendously. Some years they have had a better chance.</p><p>How has the admissions process changed over the last few years?</p><p>ROSEN: It has gotten to be a more stressful experience for all concerned. Colleges treat admissions more as a marketing venture. Students and their families are increasing focused on gaining admission to a prestigious and well-known school, sometimes for the wrong reasons. They need to look more closely at finding the best fit for their particular needs. And sometimes this means going to a little-known institution that may serve them better.</p><p>HERTZ: More applications by more students who are more conscious of financial aid/scholarship considerations.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>My College Guide is a print and web-based guide to help college-bound students with admissions, college search, and college survival.

Why should you, anyway? You can draw like the masters: Boticelli, Michaelangeo, Da Vinci. There wasn’t a landscape scene your brushes didn’t like, and there wasn’t any portrait you couldn’t draw. You can sketch anything that exists!</p><p>But as with any talent, you must have realized that this is one big world we live in. There is always room for improvement, and although your work might speak for itself, a degree behind you may be just what employers are looking for. Therefore, you muster all your reserves; you pack your easel, your brushes, and your palette and head north to the nearest art college.</p><p>1. Good choice?</p><p>Art school will definitely benefit you as an artist. Your innate talent will benefit from the proven concepts and techniques you can learn here. It may be that you already know the basics and the techniques of your art. Rest assured that there are always things the art school can teach you that you won''t already know.</p><p>Art school also develops in its students a love and appreciation for the different forms of art. It opens to the student new vistas of learning and expressing. Even if only for that reason, Art school would be worth every penny.</p><p>2. Who Is Art School Suited For?</p><p>Artists are a rare kind. They seem to be able to create masterpieces without complicated theories and computations. It’s as if they are moved by instinct to draw, paint, and create visually pleasing artworks. Some artists, when asked about their artwork, would simply shrug and say they didn''t know what motivated them, and they just felt like painting it. Art school should not aim to correct this freewheeling style of artistry. It should, however, provide the basic techniques and theories on art and creativity. Instead of suppressing natural skill, it should develop and enlighten it by explaining the concepts behind art. Unlike what most people think, there truly is a science behind art.</p><p>Artists sometimes just create art. But after Art College, they come to a realization of theories behind what they have done by instinct. Fundamental theories can only improve and supplement the talent students have.</p><p>3. What to Learn?</p><p>When choosing an Arts College, look into the nature of its programs.</p><p><pre>- Is it solely a graphic design school or does it offer courses in other specific areas? \r - Is this school well-known for its emphasis on its programs?\r - Is the school recognized internationally?\r - Is the class size large or small?\r - How many years will the program be in total?\r - Does the school provide any statistics or downloadable documents outlining the percentage of its graduates that are now working in their chosen field?</pre></p><p>4. Specialize!</p><p>Remember that the subject of art is not just a big blob with the label art. It is composed of numerous subcategories and specializations. You need to choose a specialization because if you don’t, your skills will be diffused trying to learn the many branches of art. Try to improve the most at the area of your interest. It could be painting, sculpture, digital arts or others.</p><p>5. Be The Best</p><p>Also, look into whether the school participates in any graphical arts competitions or has accomplished anything of renown in the industry. This is a sure sign of their commitment to the arts and the education of its students. One of the best things one can get out of Art College is exposure to competition and industry standards. Such competition pushes one from being complacent. If you are to be a better artist, you should never be satisfied with what you already know. You should grab the opportunity to learn new and exciting things.</p><p>6. Conclusion</p><p>Your education might be the most important investment you make in your life. Without proper training, your chances at success are greatly diminished. A proper Art college will certainly train you and equip you with the tools needed to make it big in your profession.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>For more great art education related articles and resources check out <a target="_new" href="http://www.artschoolstop.com">http://www.artschoolstop.com</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

She was bored when they weren''t biting the hook, and she read. And accidentally she discovered that when put down the fishing rod, and held her hand a certain way, she could read faster. Evelyn was a teacher, and developed several speedreading methods. She coined the term speed reading.</p><p>As time went on, organizations called Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics were springing up all over the US, and throughout many of the English-speaking countries. Major corporations sent their executives to learn this new dynamic speed reading method which provided a valuable educational tool. President John F. Kennedy, and President Jimmy Carter had all White House staff members trained with the Evelyn Wood method. For about 25 hours students would study speedreading and practice the pacing, and scanning techniques of speed reading until proficient.</p><p>Then, after the death of John Kennedy and the death of Evelyn Wood, the organization slowly disappeared and students searched everywhere for classes to learn speed reading. From 1965 to 1981 speed reading courses had reached a lull with few teachers and no PR or advertising.</p><p>In 1979, after completing three months of travel in Latin America, Jay Polmar returned to Southern Texas and began his graduate degree ending in 1981 in Philosophy of Psychology, using a specialization in Education, and Hypnotherapy. Writing a paper on the Fine Tuning of the Human Instrument (the Human Body) and techniques of educational success, he developed courses to accelerate the learning process. This included methods of programming the brain and mind for success.</p><p>Dr Jay Polmar completed his studies for his doctorate and began teaching classes in accelerated learning, speed reading, and did private therapy in the reduction of psychologically developed disease using methods of therapies with several hundred patients in Texas and New Mexico. In 1980 his first class of Dynamic Speed Reading was given to series of volunteers in Texas and New Mexico.

As in, you don’t have to pay it back.</p><p>Here my story begins.</p><p>I asked around to make sure that what I had heard wasn’t gossip and yes it was confirmed by some of my teachers.

I had been to the library many times before.  I had even seen the closed door to the scholarship office before, but because there were no signs on the door I had always assumed it was access to the library store room and guessed it was kept closed for security reasons. Nothing is what is seems, so be diligent.\r A quick chat about eligibility followed.  Application forms were handed over. They were promptly completed and returned to the office and to my amazement within a month I was called for an interview.\r I can tell you now that my academic record was not responsible for me getting the scholarship.  It was just above average with some false starts.  Startled by this I hand to find out. So I asked. Their response was.</p><p>“You were so enthusiastic about your subject during the interview process despite your false starts that we were confident that you could overcome any problems in the future.\r We like to support people that can overcome obstacles as you will encounter many in your life.  You have shown that you can, with some of your false starts.”</p><p>Thanks to this charitable trust I was able to go to college and study Applied Biology on a four year scholarship.

That is a full time job with a biotechnology company with a two year grant to study for a master’s degree in molecular pathology in part time mode. I graduated with distinction and this led to an offer of a three year grant to study for a PhD in chemical pathology.

These 3 tips will help you learn how to connect better with your students, and be the teacher students want to learn from!', '<p>Are you looking to teach an online course for the first time?  Or have you already taught online but are looking for some tips to help you become more effective?</p><p>The world of online learning is expanding at a rapid pace.</p><p>More courses are being offered and more students are enrolling every semester.  And while teaching an online course can be done while sitting at your computer in your pajamas, being an effective online instructor requires a good deal of practice and preparation.</p><p>Of course, teaching online does take away the face to face involvement with students.  Nothing can take the place of seeing a student smile after finally understanding a difficult concept.</p><p>But online teaching can be even more rewarding than on-campus teaching, when done well.</p><p><b>What makes an effective online instructor?</b></p><p>While good teaching involves a large number of qualities and techniques, effective online teaching centers on three main points:</p><p><b>1) You must be clear about your expectations!</b></p><p>Since students are not sitting right in front of you, it is extremely important to be very clear.  Since you cannot see the students, you cannot see them sitting with a puzzled look while nodding their head in agreement.</p><p>How do you know if you are clear enough?</p><p><ul>\r <li>Ask the students.\r <li>Carefully evaluate the quality of the work, and how close the finished product matches the instructions.\r <li>Have a colleague read your material before the course begins.\r </ul></p><p>If student evaluations are distributed at the end of the semester, you can use the feedback to help you improve your course and teaching techniques – but keep in mind that by then you can no longer help the students learn what you want them to learn!</p><p><b>2) You must communicate frequently…and effectively!</b></p><p>Most students will expect you to be sitting at your computer whenever they send you a question by email.  Of course, that is not practical, nor is it reasonable.  So it is a good idea to give students a time frame in which you will respond, with 24-48 hours being typical.</p><p>And it’s not enough to just communicate frequently.  You must also communicate effectively.  While some students (especially new online students) will want you to “take them by the hand” through each step, if you already have clearly written instructions, you can direct them to the instructions.</p><p>Keep in mind that most students are not asking you questions to bother you – usually, they just want to make sure they are doing what you want them to do.  So be understanding, even when you get questions that make you shake your head.</p><p>If you get the same questions frequently, it is a good idea to save the questions – and your responses – to create a “frequently asked questions” section.</p><p><b>3) You must let your personality shine through!</b></p><p>If students just wanted to read a book, they wouldn’t need you to read it for them.  So, when teaching online, avoid taking the “easy way out” by simply posting a few readings and having students answer the questions:</p><p><ul>\r <li>Add a little of your personality to your assignments and communications (but be careful when using humor, as it is difficult to convey online).\r <li>Give real life examples that you have learned from being the subject matter “expert”.\r <li>Create interesting and interactive assignments to help students really learn the material.\r </ul></p><p>Good teaching, like being good at anything, takes practice.</p><p>If you are clear - if you stay in close contact with your students - and if you create an interesting learning experience, you will be the online instructor that students want to learn from!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Kris Bickell is the director of distance learning at a small private University in Connecticut, and an experienced online instructor.

Colleges desire to have students who succeed academically but also want creativity as well.', '<p>Recently, colleges are reviewing too many applications where student are addicted to getting good grades, but sacrificing the time to figure out what makes them “tick” becoming somewhat robotic in an increasing competitive atmosphere.  Although the academic criteria remains the driving force of college admissions, the problem lies with what to do when you have too many applicants have the GPA between 3.80-4.0.  Many of us have heard the stories of the students with the 4.0 not getting in, while students with less academic numbers are.  Sure, colleges want students who will do well academically at their campus, but also they want their students to come in with ideas and energy towards developing innovation, contributing creativity, and eventually receiving recognition.  With this in mind, colleges need students who can go beyond the expectation, who has a love in life whether its sports, volunteer work, a talent, traveling, the list goes on. Most importantly, students need to articulate this “difference” in a 4-8 page application.</p><p>Ok, now how to do this.  It is important that students do two things at all times while maintaining a good academic record: 1) Have the personal time to breathe and relax, and 2) Commit to something that they love (or at least like).  Students who are committed to one activity for 2-4 years show a much stronger commitment and level of motivation compared to the student with 20 for short periods of time.  And still, students involved with more two or more activities for 2-4 years shows even potential.</p><p>When I was an admission counselor for a University of California campus, I questioned the college application that listed a slew of activities, which seemed to have no connection or correlation to one another.  The applicant would squeeze activities on the sides of the pages “1 month volunteering at the hospital, 2 times going to the homeless shelter, 2 months interning at the pet adoption center, 6 months taking piano lessons, etc.” Although the page was “full,” my first assumption was full of questionable motivation and lack of commitment.  I questioned if the student only participated in these things for the sole purpose of filling out this page, and hoped to have an explanation in the student’s essay.  Many times I don’t get the explanation and my assumption continues on.</p><p>Always keep in mind that colleges want student who can think critically and pursue an idea, not student who can follow rules and meet expected criteria – it’s about thinking outside the box.

As a graduate student in this field myself, I will be able to provide you with the absolute best advice one can get in regards to this topic.</p><p>1. Area of Focus</p><p>The first thing that you need to know about schools of this nature is that they are designed with everyone in mind, and that means people going into the program may have absolutely no experience. In my case, they asked for a portfolio of work as part of the admission process. So, if you are self-taught and eager to solidify your already existing knowledge, or a total beginner, this is a good choice for you. If, however, you have already completed a similar program, you may wish to take a new program merely to upgrade your skills (because the field of new media is always changing). If you can, it really, really, really helps if you take a freehand drawing course prior to learning how to draw using a computer.</p><p>2.  Recognition</p><p>- Does the school participate in any graphical arts competitions?</p><p>- Have students accomplished anything of reknown in the industry?</p><p>3. Teachers</p><p>Trust me, this doesn''t go without saying. The quality of your education will be directly related to the instructors. I have never encountered an instructor that wasn''t immensely knowledgeable about the subject area. Of course, there is a big difference between knowing the subject area and being able to teach (that is, to convey that information, and manage students, answer questions, etc).</p><p>4. Job Placement</p><p>100% make sure that you get into a program that incorporates on-the-job experience. Or at least a practicum. This usually is 100 hours of real on-the-job experience and it is absolutely invaluable to your career.</p><p>5. Curriculum And Tools</p><p>You must assess whether the curriculum is relevant to you field of study. You may want to compare the curricula of different schools to see which offers the best form of education. As it so happens in my case, the administration did something they have never done before: changed the curriculum halfway through the program. The reasoning behind this was that the software we were scheduled to be instructed in would soon be discontinued on the Mac. It really pays off if you can see the facilities beforehand so you know what tools they are using. Don''t just oogle at the computers, snoop around and see the programs directory and make note of what programs are installed, and if they are the latest versions.</p><p>6. Student to Teacher Ratio</p><p>Graphic design is kind of an industry that more or less demands personal contributions on every project. For this reason, you can''t just be known as the photoshop guy, it is your responsibility to be well versed in a lot of different programs and techniques for creating stunning graphics and illustrations. And that means you will definately need one-on-one instruction, or at least the ability to stop the class in case you get lost. These programs are very fast-paced and if you don''t make sure you fully understand concepts in the first semester you will get hopelessly lost - fast.</p><p>7. Accreditation</p><p>Accreditation means the school has passed a certain standards of educational quality. If you can, ask for literally one minute of the head departments time and find out a listing of companies that students have been hired into.</p><p>8. Cost</p><p>A full education in graphic design can cost anywhere from 13,000 to 16,000 dollars for an intensive one-year program (120 credits). The goal here is to find a university, college, or technical institute that is recognized internationally for excellence. Let''s face it, Harvard University will look a lot better on your resume than Texas Community College. Three great recognized schools in are BCIT located in Vancouver Canada (Vancouver is the equivalent of Hollywood for graphic designers, web designers, and all new media experts), the Art Institute (with locations worldwide), and the Vancouver Film School (VFS) that has graphic design programs that are very specialized.</p><p>9. Scholarships</p><p>You might want to consider whether the design school you are looking at offers any scholarships. You also might want to know the terms to them too. Some schools offer scholarships based on academic performance. Some offer them based on art competitions they hold regularly. You should qualify for a national student loan either way, and repayment is extremely affordable.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>For more great graphic design schools related articles and resources check out  <a target="_new" href="http://www.design-school-review.com">http://www.design-school-review.com</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

For many it is the first time away from home and family, a step into adulthood.  For those furthering their education in a new country, the changes are vastly greater.  In addition to being in a new situation calling for more self-sufficiency and autonomy, the international student must learn to cope with a different culture, unfamiliar attitudes and expectations, and possibly a new language.  Even variations in food, clothing, and shelter can be intimidating to those already facing a new scholastic system, language barriers, and religious and racial concepts different from those they have always known.</p><p>The typical student arrives on campus with a sense of hope and optimism to balance the fear of the unknown.

Some people will enjoy learning about your background and cultural differences and teach you about theirs.  They will treat you with respect and help you find your place among them.  Unfortunately, there are others who will see your differences as an invitation to take advantage of you or even as a threat to themselves.  This type of person can make it very difficult for you to settle into your new life in a positive way.  They might use racial or ethnic slurs, disregard your input in class or a social gathering, or even attempt to lure you into activities that are contrary to your better judgment.  Everyone likes to have a good time and fit into a group, but it is necessary to accept responsibility for your own actions and withdraw from a situation or group if you find yourself falling away from your main goal of getting the best education possible.</p><p>People are made up of a variety of different feelings, thoughts and actions.  Social status or position in a hierarchy does not change that.  It is possible to find good friends in unexpected places.  Even professors demonstrate these various characteristics.

Without a topic, you cannot proceed to writing or defending the proposal phase; and more importantly, you cannot begin researching or writing the thesis or dissertation</p><p>I have provided 10 tips to help you get moving toward your goal of completing your degree:<br>\r <blockquote>\r 1. Don’t Panic — Keep Things in Perspective</p><p>Let’s face it, not too many people will read a masters thesis or doctoral dissertation. A thesis or dissertation is not the type of document that piques the general public’s interest mainly because of its academic rigor and writing style. The topic is generally of interest only to the student, experts in the field and the student’s advisor and committee members. <br></p><p>2. Be Organized — Maximize Your Research Efforts</p><p>In order to maximize your research efforts, you must be organized and efficient in your search efforts. The more organized you are in the beginning, the more time you will have to write your thesis. Be diligent about keeping track of your files in the early phases of your research to reduce your stress levels later on when your enthusiasm begins to wane. If you have to back track on your research efforts, being organized from the beginning will help make the process less painful.<br></p><p>3. Choose a Subject Area First — Then a Topic</p><p>The more information you consume in your broad subject area, the more patterns will emerge. In your coursework readings, you may notice repeated results and conclusions by more than one source, or facts that favor one view more than another. Paying attention to these patterns should help you become more conversant with the relevant literature as well as help you to narrow your focus. Narrowing your topic should be done with help from your advisor and committee members.<br></p><p>4. Consider Expanding a Masters Thesis Into a Dissertation</p><p>If you’re working towards a PhD and you wrote a Masters thesis, consider expanding on that topic for your dissertation. You already are familiar with the topic and much of the research is done. This approach can accelerate your progress towards your goal: Completion! <br></p><p>5. Make Sure The Topic Is Interesting</p><p>It is imperative that both you and your advisor are interested in your thesis/dissertation topic. Some advisors are reluctant to suggest topics because of the implicit responsibilities associated with guiding a student through the process from start to completion. Your advisor’s enthusiasm for your topic will determine his or her willingness to read, support, fund, and provide timely feedback and direction to your work.<br></p><p>6. Choose a Solvable And Manageable Research Problem</p><p>It is important to select a problem that is narrow enough that you can address it or solve it in a reasonable period of time. You should select a topic that can be completed within a two-year time frame. <br>\r A longer time frame could allow many unexpected and competing events to occur. If you find yourself spending an exorbitant amount of time pursuing and identifying a research problem, it is possible that the problem is not solvable. With a longer time frame, you also run the risk of someone else identifying and solving the problem before you do. Hence, the concept of “original” contribution to the field is lost and you might have to start over. Moreover, you run the risk of your enthusiasm diminishing.<br></p><p>7. The Research Problem Must Be Worthy Of Your Time</p><p>Choosing a topic that is compelling enough to sustain further research is critical. Employers evaluate potential employees based on the student’s ability to not only finish the dissertation but also make future contributions to the field.</p><p>8. Make Your Research Topic Original- Has It Been Done Before?</p><p>The prerequisite for finding a new research topic is to be informed because most things have been studied before. Staying on top of the current debates in your academic field puts you in a position to identify the gaps in knowledge. After identifying the gaps, all you need to figure out is what kinds of information will fill these gaps. <br></p><p>9. Hone Your Research Skills</p><p>One way to evaluate your research skills and make sure they are up to par is to pursue a potential topic in your Research Methods or Statistics courses where you can get immediate feedback from an instructor. You can use these courses to work out potential problems in your methodology or your review of the literature; thus allowing you to work out any kinks earlier in your academic career rather than later.<br></p><p>10. As You Read — Ask the Following Questions.<br></p><p><pre>•	What is the Research Question in the Study? \r •	Did the Researcher Focus on the Wrong Group/subjects? \r •	Did the Research Leave Some Group/Something Out? \r •	Is the Methodology Faulty? \r •	Were the Findings Faulty? \r •	Can I Pursue the Author’s Recommendation for Future Research? \r •	What Are the Limitations of the Study?</pre></p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>About the Author: As a single mother, professor Wendy Y.

Try the mind map technique and see if it helps you to learn better and remember better when you are studying for tests.', '<p>If you are a university or college student, you probably make a lot of notes when you are attending classes or reading your text books.  Then later you review the notes you made when you are preparing for exams.</p><p>You may have wondered if there a right way or a wrong way to take notes.  Does one method of note-taking work better than another?</p><p>There is probably no one way that works best for all people in all situations, since everyone’s brain is so unique.</p><p>The main problem with taking notes the traditional way is that this is a very passive process.  Simply taking notes does not get the brain very involved in interacting with the information.  If you can get your brain to get more actively involved in organizing the new material you will remember it better.</p><p>If you are strong in visual learning, you can benefit from making notes that include lots of graphs and drawings, even cartoons!  If you are very high in auditory skills and weak in the visual area you will do better by tape-recording all the notes you need to remember.</p><p>The following technique for note-taking is particularly effective for people who are highly visual.  This method of making notes is sometimes called "mind-mapping" or making a "learning map".</p><p>Although it takes some practice to use mind-mapping effectively, most people who use it find they can retain and remember far more information with a lot less work.</p><p>The essence of the learning-map (also known as "memory-map", or "mind-map") technique is quite simple.  You will need a blank piece of paper, the larger the better.  You will need at least one pen, more if you want to use a variety of colors.</p><p>You will be trying to fill the entire page with your notes, so it is important to keep the size of your writing quite small.  With practice you should be better able to judge what size of writing will work effectively.</p><p>As you listen to the lecturer, or read the article you are studying, decide what you think the central theme is.  For example, you might be listening to a lecture where you decide the central theme seems to be, "Conditions in Europe on the eve of World War 2".</p><p>Or you might be listening to a talk that has a central theme of "Strategies that plants use to survive winter".</p><p>Once you have decided what the central theme is, jot down the words in the center of the page, and draw a circle around the main theme.  Don''t try to write down a sentence or a paragraph, just get down enough of the key words that will bring the ideas back into you mind.</p><p>Keep listening or reading, watching for the first main sub-theme.</p><p>When you come across the first major sub-theme, pick a spot on the page to jot down a few key words that sum up the sub-theme.  Draw a circle around the sub-theme words, and then join your sub-theme circle to the main theme circle with a line.</p><p>Each time you come across a new major sub-theme, write down a few key words to summarize the new idea, and draw a circle around those words.  Then draw a line to join the sub-theme circle to the main idea circle in the center of the page.  Eventually you will have a circle in the center with several spokes radiating from it.</p><p>The lines or spokes don''t have to be straight, and they can be of any length required.  The "circles" don’t have to be circles; they can be squares, triangles, or oval squiggles if you prefer.  You can use different colors to help you organize the ideas better.</p><p>As the speaker or writer continues to present his ideas, you will find that some of the ideas being presented are additional supporting details that clarify or illustrate one of the sub-themes you have already identified.  In this case you will write these "sub-sub-themes" down using just a few words, enclose them in a circle or squiggle, and link them to their sub-theme with a line.</p><p>Eventually your sub-theme circles may have many spokes radiating from them as the author or lecturer continues to present his ideas.  At a glance you will be able to take in the dominant themes of the talk and the underlying organizational structure of the ideas.</p><p>If you happen to have any ideas of your own while you are reading or listening to the lecture, jot them down as well.  This shows you have your brain actively interacting with the material.</p><p>When you make a mind map or a learning map of all your notes, you create a very visual document that differs a lot from traditional methods of making notes for class.</p><p>People who learn very well visually will particularly benefit from the way that learning maps clearly show the relationships between main themes, sub-themes and supporting facts and ideas.</p><p>Try this method and see if this is the note-taking technique that works best for you!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>This article was written by learning expert Royane Real.

It is a financial assistance given by organizations or agencies to support all kinds of schools and studies.</p><p>Q. How do you apply for nursing school grants?</p><p>A. The most recognized nursing school grants program is from the U.S. Government. It is called Federal Student Aid or FAFSA.  Money awards or grants could be given to any qualifying student and does not need to be paid back.</p><p>1. Usage of grants</p><p>These grants could be used for long-term nursing training or for the entire four or five years of your college. Many of these nursing grants are used in the cost of the study or program. They could be used in thesis of nursing students and other medical studies.</p><p>2. Planning</p><p>By planning to acquire nursing school grants, you are ahead on everyone else. Request for a submission form and check for the deadline of the application process. Remember to complete the form with valid information. Double-check your work. Get hold of the procedures in applying for nursing school grants and follow it correctly. You should send your application sooner than the date of the deadline. By preparing earlier, you would prevent missing the deadline and qualifying for the nursing school grants.

Eligibility</p><p>The grants would be given to any individual (attending private or public schools. or any educational organizations (whether private or public offices. that has been qualified to receive the grants. The main key to qualifying is to prove the nurse’s capability on safety and health training (whether college level or professional level). The nursing school grants could be also based on the financial need of the student, the ranking of the grades, and special talents. The agency would be the one to pass the criteria for the applicants.</p><p>4. What Amount Should You Aim For?</p><p>The amount of the grants would depend on the criteria passed by the nursing student. Although there are only 208 grants provided a year, the nursing student applying for grants should be able to meet the requirements.

Completing your graduate degree is not good grades it''s about perseverance and understanding the unwritten rules of graduate school.', '<p>Even if you are not a political science major, to be successful in graduate school you must also major in your department’s politics if you want to finish your degree. Not paying attention to your department’s culture can hinder your progress despite your intellectual ability. <br></p><p>A department’s culture is the traditional patterns, norms, values, beliefs and behaviors that are passed down to new faculty and students alike. Ideally these unwritten and hidden rules are transmitted through the apprenticeship/mentoring relationship that exists between you and your advisor. <br></p><p>Although students are indoctrinated into some of the department’s culture by the written rules found in the Graduate Student Handbook, graduate students are often left to figure out the unwritten rules on their own. <br></p><p>Below are 10 rules that you won’t find in any handbook. <br><blockquote>\r <b>1. Keep Up With Your Cohort: </b></p><p>Some students suffer from trying to be perfect. Taking too long to complete your degree is frowned upon in Academia. If you tend to pile up a number of incompletes because you are a workaholic and are never satisfied with the quality of work you are able to produce within a given timeframe, you need to be aware that it is better to get a grade of “B” than an Incomplete. <br></p><p>The faculty’s confidence in a student’s ability to complete a thesis/dissertation is diminished by this need for perfection and lack of completion. Piling up a number of incompletes signals to professors that you cannot finish what you start. If you cannot complete your assignments within a semester, professors become leery that you will not be able to finish your degree within a reasonable amount of time given that you have to set your own deadline. <br></p><p><b>2. Participation, Networking, and Visibility, are Critical:</b><br></p><p>Because of time restrictions, you cannot participate in all department activities. You must be selective in terms of which activities and how long or often you participate. Make no mistake, some participation is required. Your attendance and participation in national conferences, campus workshops, and “brown bag” presentations are important components of your success in graduate school. Therefore, choose carefully the number and kinds of activities that you can be involved with. <br></p><p>Networking is a skill that is learned with time, practice and patience. I have known some professors whose presentation skills in the classroom have been lack luster and dry. These same professors display a totally different personality during office hours, at department functions, or at a conference. Attending department functions allows you and your professor to get to know each other on a more personal level. You should take advantage of these opportunities because as a professor you will be asked to represent your department in this type of social setting, especially when you serve on hiring committees. <br></p><p>Your visibility in national, campus, and department events helps you to become better known by your advisor, committee, and other individuals in your field. Your ability to network with faculty will help when it comes to securing fellowships, assistantships, opportunities to work in a lab, and recommendations for the future. <br></p><p><b>3. Don’t Leave Before You Are Done:</b><br></p><p>When you are ABD, time is not your friend. If you leave the university before you finish with your degree, you run the risk of not finishing at all. If you leave the comfort and support of your academic department your enthusiasm to write your thesis/dissertation will inevitably diminish. You will be faced with many competing events that will take priority over writing your thesis/dissertation. <br></p><p>When I got my first job offer they wanted to make sure I was finished with my dissertation before I showed up on campus to begin my new role as assistant professor. They said “take another semester if you have to, but finish your dissertation.” They had learned from experience that once you begin your new job it is difficult to find the necessary time to work on your thesis/dissertation. <br></p><p>Much of your time as a new professor will be stressful. Your time will be spent learning how to be a professor, meeting with your students, grading papers, making up assignments, and serving on campus and department committees. Much of the stress will be the result of the new job, new location, new friends, and new responsibilities. <br></p><p><b>4. Prepare For Your Defense By Attending \r Another Student’s Defense:</b><br></p><p>Your advisor will not let you defend your document until he/she thinks it is sufficiently polished and if he/she is relatively sure that you will pass. Hence, when your advisor agrees to a defense date he/she believes that you are ready. <br> \r Nothing really prepares you for a thesis, proposal, or thesis/dissertation defense other than seeing the process unfold for yourself. These hearings are sometimes open to the public. Your attendance at a defense hearing should be based on the tradition in your department. Even if it says in the graduate student handbook that the defense hearing is “open to the public” but no one in your department ever attends another student’s defense it is wise not to break this tradition. The repercussions will not be pretty. <br></p><p>If you can’t attend another student’s defense ask fellow graduate students about their “hazing” process. You should focus on questions such as these: \r <pre>•	How did it start? \r •	How did the advisor facilitate the process? \r •	How difficult were the questions? \r •	How did you know it was over? \r •	Did anyone else other than committee members attend the hearing?</pre> <br></p><p><b>5. For PhDs Teaching Is Not The Primary Task:</b><br></p><p>Even if you get top scores on your teaching evaluations as a teaching assistant, understand that the PhD is a research degree. Many professors believe that teaching is a task that can be learned over time with practice. As a professor your tenure and promotion will be based primarily on your publishing record. To prepare you for the "publish-or-perish" academic environment, the faculty focuses primarily on developing your research skills. <br></p><p>Hence, the faculty values research and the apprenticeship model above everything else. They believe that the majority of your time in graduate school should be spent conducting research. As such, securing a fellowship or traineeship/research assistantship is better than a teaching assistantship. However, securing a teaching assistantship is better than not securing any funding at all. <br></p><p>As a PhD student in a research program, participation in campus luncheon seminars is required. Presenting your research findings at a brown bag seminar gives you a chance to practice your presentation skills in a relaxed atmosphere before you ever have to teach a class, give a job talk, present at a national conference, or defend your proposal, Master’s thesis, or dissertation. Honing your presentation skills will help to increase your self-confidence in public speaking. Presenting your research findings on and off campus establishes your expertise and enhances your professional reputation. <br></p><p><b>6. Bridging The Generation Gap:<i>Don’t Complain, \r Don’t Try To Understand, Just Do</i>:</b><br></p><p>In graduate school there is often a generation gap between students, faculty, and professional staff. The faculty and staff established the culture in the department with the expectation that when students are admitted they will adjust their behaviors accordingly. Often the faculty and staff provide a graduate student orientation in hopes of answering many questions before they become issues later on. They do not expect to debate the rules and traditions of the department. <br></p><p>Some of us are use to debating with our parents, friends, or colleagues to win them over to our way of thinking. While some individuals can appreciate and support this type of interaction, understand that others do not. You are expected to “adhere to” not change, the strict deadlines, rules and regulations of graduate school even if you do not agree with them. Spending an exorbitant amount of time trying to understand the “hoops” and “hurdles” is time that can be better spent jumping over them. Your task from the first day of graduate school is to figure out how many “hoops" and "hurdles” there are and start jumping. The sooner you learn this unwritten rule the better. <br></p><p><b>7. Treat The Professional Administrative Staff Well:</b><br></p><p>Don’t underestimate or undervalue the role of the administrative staff in your department. These professionals like your advisor and committee members can either hinder or propel your educational progress. <br></p><p>They are responsible for managing students’ records, paperwork and information. They provide timely information on all department deadlines, rules, regulations and eligibility requirements with respect to course requirements, course scheduling, qualifying/preliminary exams, funding opportunities, and the necessary signatures. They can or cannot remind you of upcoming deadlines. It is in your best interest to manage these relationships in a positive way. <br></p><p>For example, when my advisor was leaving for a year long absence, I made sure that I checked with the graduate secretary to see if there were any documents that needed his signature before he left. Be sure to find creative ways to say thank you to the administrative staff for all that they do. <br></p><p><b>8. Securing Funding For Historically Disadvantaged And Underrepresented Groups: </b><br></p><p>I was financially able to attend graduate school because a senior researcher at my institution had a $5 million NIH research grant. More importantly, he was willing as the principal investigator to apply for a NIH Research Supplement For Underrepresented Minorities to support me for six years. The addition of a minority student to his project did not cost him any funds from the original grant. Instead he gained additional funds. These additional funds were part of monies set aside by funding institutions such as NIH to support researchers who are members of underrepresented minority groups. Supplements are also available for the following groups: persons with disabilities, persons seeking research careers or re-entering research, and minorities. <br></p><p>According to the website Research Assistant.com, the best first step to obtaining independent research funding often is to receive training and supervision from an experienced senior researcher. They suggest that NIH Research Supplements for Underrepresented Minorities offer an excellent opportunity to receive grant funds to work on an existing NIH grant with a senior researcher in a particular area of interest. In other words, if you are looking to obtain research funding and have no idea where to start, start with the above website and a faculty member who has a federal grant. <br></p><p><b>9. Visibility and the Competition for Scarce Resources:</b> <br></p><p>Unlike the undergraduate experience, graduate school involves competition for scarce resources such as: (a) research funds; (b) office space; (c) fellowships; (d) co-authorships; (e) time with faculty members; and (f) information. Lack of information and visibility are two of the key issues that put many students at a disadvantage. <br></p><p>When the faculty are making decisions about these scarce resources they need to know who you are. If you have not been on campus and have not participated in any department events your name will not be familiar to the people who are parceling out these resources. To stay informed about these decisions and to put your name at the top of the list, visibility is necessary to be considered an active member of the department’s academic community. <br></p><p><b>10.Your Lack of Class Participation is Interpreted as Lack of Knowledge:</b><br></p><p>In graduate school expect your workload to be substantially more than any one person could complete. The reading requirements can be sometimes overwhelming and burdensome. In addition to the required readings, in the syllabus you might find supplemental (recommended) readings as well. Don’t waste time complaining to the professor who assigned the reading; he/she fully expects you to come to class prepared to discuss the readings. Find creative ways to cover the reading materials for the course. <br></p><p>For example, in graduate school I was able to familiarize myself with all the readings by forming and participating in a class study group. We would divide the readings amongst ourselves and provide a summary for each reading. The summary included the abstract, the research question, the methodology, limitations, and the findings. Using this method allowed all of us to participate in the class discussion. In class, it is always better to make <i>any</i> contribution on something than not to participate at all. Sometimes class participation involves making a preemptive strike; raise your hand and volunteer an answer on something that you are prepared for before you are called upon to answer a question you don''t know the correct answer to.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>About the Author: As a single mother, professor Wendy Y.

He was intelligent, well respected in the field, and had the reputation of being an advocate for his student advisees. I chose him because he was reliable and a great advocate for me.

Hence, you need to select an advisor who can be an advocate for you. To be your best advocate, your advisor should have tenure and the respect of his peers. As chair of your committee, peer respect will be invaluable when your advisor has to supervise the other committee members and facilitate your defense hearing.</p><p><b>2. Interview Fellow Students/Advisees: </b></p><p>Although a faculty member might be respected in his or her discipline, be aware that some faculty members might be difficult to work with; advisors sometimes ask for a draft when what they really want is a polished piece. Some advisors might prefer to work with the same sex graduate student. Others may or may not be willing to co-author with their graduate students.</p><p>Your peers are your greatest resource; advanced graduate students are often willing to share information about what it is like to work for or with a particular faculty member. As a possible advisee, you need inside information on:</p><p><dir>•	Availability and accessibility of the advisor</p><p>•	Timeliness and quality of the feedback</p><p>•	His/her expectations—are they realistic?</p><p>•	The working atmosphere in the lab</p><p>•	Management style—micro or macro</p><p>•	Facilitation skills during defense hearings</p><p>•	Average time his/her advisees take to finish </dir></p><p><b>3. Be Professional With Advisor/Committee Members: </b></p><p>The quality of the advisee/advisor relationship varies and is based on the commitment level and personalities of your advisor and yourself. Both of you have some responsibility for making this relationship work successfully. You should be as professional with your advisor/committee members as possible.</p><p><dir>•	Let your advisor/committee member know that you value his or her time. Get to your scheduled meetings on time. Don’t sweat it if your advisor/committee member is late.</p><p>•	Be prepared with an agenda for your regularly scheduled meetings-- prepare questions ahead of time.</p><p>•	Call and cancel if you will not be able to make your scheduled meeting.</p><p>•	Send a follow-up email confirming any items and resolutions that were discussed during the meeting.</p><p>•	Prepare a coversheet with an outline of your document indicating the type of feedback you are looking for.</p><p>•	Don’t get frustrated if they ask for another copy of the latest draft of your document even if you haven’t made any changes since you gave it to them last week.</p><p>•	Always bring a hard copy of the chapter to be discussed with you.</p><p>•	Takes notes at all meetings; you won’t remember everything once you leave the office.</dir></p><p><b>4. Don’t Assume, Ask: </b></p><p>The relationship between you, your advisor and committee members varies by the amount of direction, personal interaction, and psychological support. In addition, the type of criticism given and the frequency of interaction will depend on the type of relationship you and your advisor has established. It is quite possible that each committee member could have different expectations of you.</p><p>It is your responsibility to find out what level of participation each member of the committee is willing to commit to. I know of a student who directly asked each committee member “what do you need to see in this dissertation for you to sign-off on it?” By asking ahead of time, she was able to address each member’s concerns with the help of her advisor.</p><p><b>5. Understanding Your Advisor And Committee Members:</b></p><p>The best academic advisor does not have the time to hold your hand throughout your academic career. The academic advisor’s time is limited because, after all, he or she is a professor first and is getting paid to teach courses, advise graduate students, supervise graduate research, write books or journal articles, and serve on campus- and university-wide committees.</p><p>Moreover, your advisor went through the same process without much assistance from his/her advisor when he/she attended graduate school. Therefore, the tradition of completing a thesis or dissertation is a lonely process and an unsympathetic advisor does not want to cheat you out of having the same experience he/she suffered through years ago. Hence, your academic advisor’s main commitment is to supervise your research project. He/she will not be your friend, therapist, financial aid counselor, or marital advisor.</p><p><b>6. Choose your battles wisely—Handling Conflicts\r and Disagreements: </b></p><p>Your advisor is the coordinator of your thesis or dissertation project. While the major role of your advisor is to share his or her expertise with you to help you develop your ideas, your advisor is also supposed to advocate on your behalf as well. Should your committee members give you conflicting advice you should bring this to your advisor’s attention.</p><p>Resolving conflicts among committee members is part of your advisor’s responsibilities. After you resolve the issue with your advisor, ask if she/he is going to be responsible for communicating the solution to the other committee members. If she/he suggests that you handle that issue it might be prudent to send your advisor an email confirming the agreed upon resolution. You might consider copying the other committee members with this confirmation.</p><p>If you and your advisor disagree you might consider writing a more persuasive argument addressing his concerns. Arguing with your advisor is not time well spent. If you spent the time choosing a well-qualified expert, an active supporter and head cheerleader, these disagreements should be minor and short-lived. You need him/her---Your advisor will be writing recommendations for you well after you have left the university.</p><p><b>7. Seeking Feedback And Advice From Your Advisor \r and Committee Members:</b></p><p>If you are having problems getting timely written or oral feedback from your advisor there are many things that you can do to move this process along. Your advisor and committee members are busy people. Consequently you must make the best use of their time. First, if you cannot get feedback from your advisor, try another committee member to keep things moving along.</p><p>Second, when you submit your thesis or dissertation chapters for review you should provide some guidance on how you want your advisor / committee member to read your document. Sometimes you might just be looking for answers as to whether or not your methodology or reasoning is logical and going in the right direction. If you want this type of feedback your advisor might not have to read as closely as he might think if you do not provide any instructions. It would be a good idea to provide an outline of your chapter so that your advisor can get a good overview of what the chapter is about and where it fits into your thesis or dissertation. Without instructions your advisor is likely to place your document in a pile of “must-read” items. Leave the grammar and editing to an editor; your advisor will give the final grammar edits on your final draft. </dir></p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>About the Author:</p><p>As a single mother, professor Wendy Y.

I saw a photo attached to an app\r showing the senior student shaking hands with the\r President of the United States. Another enclosed an\r audio tape that revealed his talent to play the fiddle\r in a country band. A girl had her photograph taken with\r a well-known professional golfer after she had won a\r state tournament. A boy included a picture of his\r debating trophies. Another had won a two day fishing\r tournament and held the trophy in a picture to prove\r it. Another had built his own computer. Still,another\r had patented her own invention, a device for counting\r inventory units. In each case the items were part of\r the requirements of the scholarship award,not just\r thrown in for effect. These are super examples of\r "personalizing" a scholarship application,but it\r doesn''t have to be that noticeable.</p><p>There were also attempts at personalization not well\r received,a picture of a girl in a very tiny bikini.\r The word thong comes to mind.

It is the committee’s job to pick a\r winner. All of the apps appear to look alike. All\r things being equal, which one is going to be chosen?\r It’s impossible to say.

Unfortunately many students who are pledging  wake up the next day with more than just a hangover.  Some wake up with severe physical problems or psychological problems as a result of hazing.  Some primary people in the college group will do anything during the hazing "process."</p><p>The hazing process has many different parts to the process that include, but are not limited to: <br></p><p>Binge drinking<br>\r Paddling<br>\r Spitting<br>\r Forcing participants to overeat<br>\r Beating<br>\r Mental or physical intimidation<br></p><p>Hazing activities and/or processes are extremely hard to minimize or categorize.

You may not be able to stop your child from experimenting, but you could have an influence on the outcome.  Teaching your children how to have a good time without drugs or alcohol should be a primary consideration.  If you find that they are partying, don''t try to stop them.  Rather talk to them about what safe partying is so they can be safe and still enjoy college life.  Here are some ideas:</p><p>*  If they are going to host a party, speak to their neighbors so they will know when it is going to be and how long it should last.<br></p><p>*  Parties do not need alcohol or drugs.  When they create their party theme ask them to create it without the thought of drugs or alcohol included.<br></p><p>*  Follow local fire laws and make sure they are aware of how to put out simple fires should they occur or call 911.<br></p><p>*  Call 911 in the event of an emergency and have a clear access path to the party area.<br></p><p>A party can be safe and fun if you take the precautions early and teach your children what to do and how to do it.</p><p><b>There are some dangers in and around the campus and dorms</b>.</p><p>Many college students, especially freshmen, live on campus.

You will likely need to complete several assignments and you will need to learn how to take a brief. You will also need to learn how to read blueprints, and how to use computer assisted design software.

All states and the District of Columbia require licensure before you can practice. You will need to work under the supervision of a qualified architect to gain practical experience.

Few people realize that an online nursing degree is pretty much the same as any traditional school.  They offer all the same type of degrees and variations of courses that the traditional schools offer and they do it with a fraction of the cost of a traditional school would charge for the same thing.  This has made online schools so much more popular.  Not to mention the fact that these schools can offer the better and up to date classes that the traditional schools have a hard time keeping up on. Budgetary restraints are more prevalent at traditional land based schools.</p><p>The first thing you need is a computer with an internet connection.  This is the most crucial part of any online school as they cannot teach you other than through email and online discourse.  Many of the schools of this type ask that you have a high speed internet connection such as DSL or cable broad band. This helps the students to better keep up with all that is going on and increases the download times many times over.

The SAT evidently has become synonymous to the college application process. Moreover, it is considered to be one of the most accurate evaluating indicators of applicants’ college success.</p><p>The SAT gained amazing popularity among educational institutions, which are more likely to accept the SAT, rather than any other college testing programs.</p><p>Whereas, for students the SAT is the most important test they have to take in their life. Thus, when the matter concerns college admissions and awarding scholarship, no exam is more crucial and responsible.</p><p>That’s why, the recent innovation, introduced by the College Board, which administers the SAT, became the most controversial and nerve-racking focal point for college-bound students. Indeed, it wasn’t the bolt from the blue, because educators and learners have been waiting for some changes to come since June 2002, when the College Board announced a series of changes to the SAT that were implemented only in March 2005.</p><p>New SAT - New Challenges</p><p>The new SAT Reasoning Test was taken equivocally, to some extent, because of its complexity.</p><p>The new SAT is 3 hours and 45 minutes long, and scored on a 600-2400 scale. Besides, adding the questions from the allegebra-II to math section, and changing verbal analogies and quantitative comparisons into critical reading. The SAT introduced the drastic change, which became a real challenge for the majority of high school students. For the first time it will require  students to compose a timed essay.</p><p>The 25-minute essay, asking a “philosophical” questions, aims at evaluating how well students can communicate on paper and support their point of view. This section will produce a separate score on the 200-800 scale, where the essay will count only for 30 percent of the writing score, with 49 multiple-choice grammar questions. The mutiple questions will ask students to identify errors, and to improve the sentences and paragraphs.</p><p>On the one hand, this sweeping change in the approach to assessment students’ writing skills is well-grounded by the employers’ demand in people with good research, organizational and referencing writing skills. It is not a secret for anyone that nowadays good writing skills are not a privilege of the writers, but an essential skill for the many. Hence, writing extends beyond the walls of the education system into students’ later life.</p><p>Gaston Carper, the new ambitious head of the College Board, claimed in response to numerous questions as per the reason of this vital alteration, “We were hearing from schools across the country, from employers all across the country: Young people are getting out of college not able to write, entering college, where writing is much more in demand.”</p><p>Thus, on the other hand this novelty put a new heavy burden on kids, who have to place more emphasize on their writing skills. Moreover, parents of some high school students cannot afford to pay for expensive preparation classes. Hence, students, having some difficulties with writing, are deprived of the opportunity to cope with the test successfully, therefore, to receive college education. It can be interpreted as discrimination for those, who cannot set out their thoughts coherently and articulately on paper, thus, are pretty good at math, and can come through critical reading with flying colors.</p><p>One more challenge for the students to face is critical reading. This is the new name for what is used to be called the verbal portion of the test, but there will be some changes. The vocabulary is de-emphasized with the end of analogies, and comprehension questions are introduced on shorter passages, or pairs of short passages, besides the traditional longer ones.</p><p>Some words are to be said about the alterations, introduced to the math section. There is a handful of high-level algebra II questions, where the special accent is made on graphs and interpreting visual data. Apparently, it won’t be a piece of the cake for anyone.</p><p>“Overall, the changes have brought praise from some, who say the new test is more relevant to what students need to know for college. But there are also concerns they will more negatively affect students from weaker schools, and that the essay makes this test more cashable.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the changes to the SAT “go through a special lens of evaluation”, and really create much confusion. Students will have to make additional preparation, beyond the regular course work, seeking for preparation courses, which offer tutoring on weak subjects, provide an opportunity to take practice tests, and emphasize the fundamentals of good essay writing.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Linda Correli is a staff writer of <a target="_new" href="http://www.CustomResearchPapers.us/">http://www.CustomResearchPapers.us/</a> and an author of the popular online tutorial for students "What Teachers Want: Master the Art of Essay Writing in 10 Days", available at <a target="_new" href="http://www.Go2Essay.com/">http://www.Go2Essay.com/</a> Visit Linda’s web log at <a target="_new" href="http://custom-research-papers.blogspot.com/">http://custom-research-papers.blogspot.com/</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

The situation gets more perplexing as many legitimate universities and colleges turn to distance learning; so many students make up their minds to take classes online and get their degrees remotely.</p><p>A degree is one of the most important and expensive money investments people will have to make in their lifetime. Without a degree career doors remain closed for the majority of potential applicants. Though, the academic choice is not about to dice, putting the future career promotion at stake.</p><p>However, up to the moment more and more people, who are looking for the better career choices, and are in search of the edge in the competitive job market fall into the trap of the online scams, who offer to reward any degree in a very short period of time, sometimes as less as in five days.</p><p>A fake degree is the worst thing ever; just because a person pays money not for the knowledge he can acquire and apply in his career, though for the pseudo-credentials to trick the employers.</p><p>There are more than 300 unaccredited universities now operating. More than thirty bogus universities sell online degrees in the United States alone. While a few are start-ups or online ventures, the great majority are so called diploma or degree mills, which are bogus universities and fake schools that confer any degree at prices from $3.000 to $5.000. Diploma mills crank out “paper diplomas rather than the educational experience”, which are genuinely worthless because student’s work and operator’s handling of the mill fall behind the standard educational bench-mark.</p><p>“In his classic 1959 study of diploma mills for the American Council on Education, Robert Reid described the typical diploma mill as having the following characteristics: "no classrooms," "faculties are often untrained or nonexistent," and "the officers are unethical self-seekers whose qualifications are no better than their offerings."”</p><p>Diploma mills are fraudulent institutions of higher education that issue thousands of diplomas and confer hundreds of degrees annually, earning the aggregate income of $200 million. Diploma mills have become more prosperous because modern technology is becoming increasingly available to general public. The Internet makes bogus degrees easier to get than ever before. A huge diploma mills wave is under way, which grows stronger and stronger with each upcoming year.</p><p>John Eaton, a U.S. commissioner of education, once called diploma mills “a disgrace of the American education.”</p><p>Diploma mills prey on people’s lack of knowledge and confusion about their accreditation. It is very easy to become a victim of the online scams, who turn years of backbreaking college studying into five days’ degrees rewarding. Indeed, it is really hard to determine whether a degree earned online is really legitimate.

It is very important to verify accreditation, which is given to an institution of higher education, by an agency that is recognized by the Council on Higher Education Accreditation.</p><p>Admission criteria that consist entirely of you possessing a credit card are evidently the tricks of the online scams. It is a well-known fact that valid universities require applicants to pass entrance examinations, taking into account their existing academic records.</p><p>Getting a distance-education degree from a foreign school is a great imprudence, unless you are absolutely certain that the school''s degrees are genuine and valid in the U.S.</p><p>The main thing is to be genned up of the possible danger, to be forewarned and to double-check legitimacy of any institution of higher education you’re going to admit to.

Although finding a role-model with similar characteristics would be ideal, finding an advisor with similar research interests is one of the key components to success in graduate school.', '<p>Take a moment to consider what it might be like to function day after day in an environment in which you are “the only one” or, at minimum, one of only a few who represent your particular race, nationality, age group, ethnicity, or gender. In many graduate departments across the U.S. minorities, foreigners and even women often find themselves isolated within an intensely competitive academic environment that provides no cultural understanding or support to assist them in finishing their degree.<BR></p><p>Further exacerbating this situation is a shortage of minority faculty role models who can provide a mentoring and support system for like graduate students. A lack of diverse faculty in a department can create a signal of an unwelcoming environment for women and minorities. This may curtail the number of minority students who actually apply to graduate school, and may also contribute to the small percentage who actually complete their degree once they have enrolled. The cycle continues, the next generation of female and minority students will face the similar issues.<BR></p><p>During an orientation for admitted students visiting a department at Wisconsin, a black student quipped, “Whew; I’m sure glad there are other white people here. I wasn’t sure when I applied!” Everyone laughed, but his comment proves worthy of mention. Given the current demographics in higher education, there is no guarantee that you(as a female, foreign, or minority student) will meet other students or faculty of color in the graduate department you choose.<br></p><p>The demographics of specific departments can vary greatly. Some may feature far fewer minority students to provide a sense of community of cultural, social, emotional and professional support. If this type of support is critical for your emotional well-being, be sure that to select a department with a critical mass of minority students. For example, if a department admits two minority students each year, and the average time spent in graduate school is six years, there may possibly be 10-12 minority students in the department at any given time with whom you can interact.\r <br></p><p>A campus visit can actually be quite helpful in reducing the stress about the unknown elements of graduate school. For example, some departments have a collegial working environment, while others are more competitive. Some allow collaboration across; other disciplines others do not. During your visit to the campus, it is not out of line to ask about the number of women and minority students in the department or what level and type of funding is available for minority students. If these types of issues are important to you, it is critical that you complete appropriate due diligence prior to applying.</p><p><BR></p><p>Many women and minority graduate students are determined to find an advisor who is their same race and/or gender. My advice is to not waste your time trying! Due to the current lack of diversity among academic faculty, the chances of finding one are slim.<BR></p><p>Because there are so few of them in academia, female and minority advisors tend to be overwhelmed and overburdened by the extra mentoring responsibilities they are asked to perform … and this is particularly true of minority women! Their workloads can become even more extreme because of additional campus committee duties they may be asked to fulfill because of their race, ethnicity, or gender. For example, the chair of the department may ask them to help diversify a variety of committees on campus. And, while some female and minority faculty might feel a sense of responsibility to mentor minority graduate students, others simply do not. They should still, however, be viewed as key allies; regard these faculty members as reserve mentors rather than as advisors. <BR></p><p>Furthermore, keep in mind that race, ethnicity, and gender are simply not the best criterion for selecting an advisor. I chose my advisor because he had a reputation of being culturally sensitive to foreign students and, more importantly, for helping his students complete the program quickly. <BR></p><p>Success in graduate school often depends on a successful mentoring relationship between you and your advisor. As such, finding a faculty member with similar research interest is critical to finishing your degree, and far more important than finding a faculty member who matches your gender and/or race.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>About the Author: As a single mother, professor Wendy Y.

No more. Now it is possible to study almost any subject online. It may require more self-discipline to pursue a degree this way. However, students at online universities can attend classes at their convenience, making it possible to earn a living at the same time as earning a degree.</p><p>What to look for</p><p>There are now many online universities. Some online degree programs are offered by traditional universities with campuses, while others only exist in cyberspace. Selecting the right school and being sure your degree will be recognized by potential employers is the first step. How can you tell whether a program is a real educational experience or a diploma mill? Here are some things to find out before signing up.</p><p>Look for a university with accreditation from a recognized accrediting organization. This is important because it means the school meets established standards of quality. Well-known universities like the University of Florida, Northwestern, Purdue and Notre Dame are examples of accredited institutions. The U.S. Department of Education recognizes universities accredited by one of the six accrediting bodies. Students who attend accredited universities are usually eligible for federal student loans and the course credits they earn generally transfer to other accredited institutions.</p><p>Picking a degree program</p><p>To determine if a degree program fits your professional and personal interests, review the curriculum and course descriptions in university web sites and course catalogs. Do they offer courses in subjects of interest to you?</p><p>To learn more about whether a program might be good for you, ask about the faculty''s industry experience and the scope and focus of their research. Do they have the appropriate advanced degrees for what they teach? Find out where the professors got their degrees. If all or most of them graduated from the same online university you are considering, this is a red flag, suggesting their academic credentials are weak. A real university will have teachers who have graduated from many different schools.</p><p>How students apply what they learn to their fields of expertise and to their communities are also strong indicators of a program''s value. Ask what employers, organizations and professional associations partner with or support the university. Talk to someone at the university and explain your educational goals and career plans. Whether you wish to advance your career, change careers, make a contribution to society or become more expert in your field, be sure the program you choose will get you there. One way to find out is to learn how the university''s alumni are doing. Alumni success or lack of it reflects the quality of a university and its programs. Ask for examples of how alumni are using the knowledge they gained in their professional and personal lives.</p><p>If the university accepts everyone who applies and can afford the cost, be suspicious. A real university will require each student to meet appropriate admissions requirements.</p><p>Online teaching is different</p><p>Make sure any online universities you are considering know how to deliver and support online courses and that you have the technology you need to take them. Do the faculty members know how to guide the classroom experience to ensure learning objectives are achieved? Are your computer and Internet connection up to the task? Assignments are typically posted online and discussions take place as threaded postings. Most online courses require students to log in and contribute to discussions a certain number of times each week. Many courses let you log in any time, anywhere as long as you meet the weekly course requirements.</p><p>What type of student support services are available? How responsive are instructors to student inquiries? What opportunities are there to interact with fellow students? This interaction enables students to gain knowledge and understanding from others with a wide variety of geographic, cultural and professional perspectives. The most effective courses, especially for adult learners with years of work experience, are those in which students gain the insights and perspectives of everyone in the class.</p><p>Can you afford it?</p><p>Though attending an online university allows you to live where you do currently so you won''t pay anything extra for living expenses while you study, there will be charges for books, tuition and fees. Find out what other expenses there will be, if any, to be sure you can afford your studies. Ask if financial aid is available, as some schools offer it to online learners.</p><p>Note that tuition and fees at online universities are often higher than what is charged at their campus-based counterparts. However, these schools offer personalized support and a convenient and flexible format geared for the adult learner. If a university''s tuition and fees are significantly less expensive than other online schools, double check on its accreditation to be sure it is legitimate.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Are you looking for more information concerning Online universities and colleges ? \r Log on to <a target="_new" href="http://www.online-colleges.co.nr">http://www.online-colleges.co.nr</a> !</p><!--UdmComment-->');

Their job: to decide the constitutionality of cases. But is that what they are really doing? Can we trust that their decisions are just?', '<p>1892</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court: the highest court in the land. Their job: to decide the constitutionality of cases. But is that what they are really doing? Can we trust that their decisions are just? Two important cases in history can help answer this question. A 1896 U.S. Supreme Court case, Plessy v. Ferguson, made facilities and schools separate based on race. In another case in 1954, Brown v. Board of Education, the court reversed its decision and said that separate was not equal. These two cases teach two lessons about the U.S. Supreme Court. Plessy shows that our justice system has failed at times to establish justice. Brown shows that even though the Court rules justly, justice isn''t guaranteed.</p><p>Many events led up to Plessy v. Ferguson. For example: after the Congress withdrew federal troops from the South in 1877, conditions for blacks deteriorated. The government pushed blacks into an inferior position. The government took action to prevent blacks from voting immediately.</p><p>They embarked poll taxes, "grandfather clauses". They also segregated on trains, in parks, schools, restaurants, theaters, swimming pools, and even cemeteries. If blacks broke these segregation laws, they were likely to end up either in prison or dead!</p><p>The case of Plessy v. Ferguson was a very important case in American History because it enforced segregation even making it legal, and made segregation a concrete reality for the people of the United States. It began with a man called Homer Plessy. Plessy was 7/8 white and only had 1/8 drop of black blood in him, but under Louisiana law, was considered black. In 1890, Louisiana passed a law providing that "all railway companies carrying passengers in their coaches in this state shall provide equal but separate accommodations for the white and colored races, by providing two or more passenger coaches for each passenger train, or by dividing the passenger coaches by a partition so as to secure separate accommodations." Plessy believed that the law was unjust and so he challenged the law by refusing to leave the white railroad car. He was arrested and taken to trial. At this trial he argued that the Separate Car Act violated the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. But he was found guilty. Plessy then appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Louisiana. Again his case was upheld. Plessy appealed again in 1896 to the Supreme Court of the United States. Homer Plessy was found guilty once again. The impact of the court''s decision was a harsh one. It created a reality that was a nightmare to many. Their lives would be changed dramatically. They would officially be separated and considered low down in society.</p><p>Plessy v. Ferguson was the law of the land until 1954, when it was finally, successfully overturned by Brown v. Board of Education. In 1954, a little girl named Linda Brown in Topeka, Kansas had to walk 5 miles to school. She didn''t get recess and could not play with any of the other children who were all white. Her parents filed a case to the U.S. Supreme Court saying that there is no way blacks and whites could get equal education if they were separated. The court ruled that separate is not equal.</p><p>The amount of time between Plessy v. Ferguson and Brown v. Board of Education shows just how long it took to get justice for blacks from the Supreme Court. It amazes me that our government could even question if blacks have the right to justice. It should be basic knowledge for us to know that it is wrong to treat any people so unjustly. Just to prove my point here are some questions you can ask yourself: are blacks human beings just like whites? Do blacks and whites both have feelings and needs? And finally, is the only difference between blacks and whites is that they have a different complexion? I am confused as to why so many people, including Justices on our Supreme Court would not answer yes to all these questions. How could anyone who had any intelligence think it was acceptable to treat blacks differently?</p><p>Fortunately the Court did come to its senses in Brown v. Board of Education. Yet just because The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that separate is not equal it did not mean that blacks were automatically treated equally. After Brown v. Board of Education happened, there needed to be the Civil Rights Movement, in which many people were involved to push society to change. Two people who led the Civil Rights Movement were Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. We must acknowledge that it wasn''t only those people, there were others working and helping the same cause. There were many ways that they impacted The Civil Rights Movement. They gave speeches, wrote letters, led marches, held meetings and many other strategies. They also endured mental and physical hardships. Only through the Civil Rights Movement did the promise of Brown actually get achieved. These people were poor, wealthy, high class, low class, black, some white, short and tall. Basically, there was a wide range of different kinds of people. Not everyone automatically changed their frame of mind when The U.S. Supreme Court ruled separate is not equal. There were still many people out there who were racist and wanted to keep blacks in an inferior position.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>You may visit <a target="_new" href="http://www.TermPaperAdvisor.com">http://www.TermPaperAdvisor.com</a> and <a target="_new" href="http://www.TermPapersMadeEasy.com">http://www.TermPapersMadeEasy.com</a> for instant access to over 45,000 plus term papers and essays.

The Qu''ran is the prime source of every Muslims'' faith and practice.', '<p>There are few people on earth today who have not heard something about Islam.  Islam is one of the most prominent religions in the world today with at least 750 million people practicing.  Islam is a voluntary relationship between an individual and his creator. Islam emerged in Arabia during the early 7th century.  Islam means “submission” in Arabic, which is the basis for the religion---submitting to the Will of God.  Islamic religion is formed on the foundations of Islamic life, variety and unity is Islam, and Islam and its nonbelievers. The Islamic people had a new faith in their religion and kept their hopes high to conquer and spread the religion.  They changed the society that was used across the lands and brought a new religion that would keep the people high in assurance that they’ll always have a good spirit.</p><p>The foundations of Islamic life are based on a sacred text called the Qu’ran.  The Qu’ran is a record of the exact words revealed by God through the Angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad.  The Qu’ran is the prime source of every Muslims’ faith and practice.  It deals with all the subjects which concern us as human beings: wisdom, doctrine, worship, and law, but its basic theme is the relationship between God and his creatures.  At the same time it provides guidelines for a just society, proper human conduct and an equitable economic system.  From the time the Qu’ran was revealed, until this day there has always been a large number of Muslims who have memorized all of the Qu’ran, letter by letter.   Not one letter of the Qu’ran has been changed over the centuries.</p><p>Another source for the basis of Islamic life is al-Hadith, or sunnah.  This is a vast body of transmitted stories and sayings attributed to the Prophet and his comparisons.  Unlike the Qu’ran, these stories are not assembled in a single, absolutely accepted text.  There are actually many collections of Hadith. Over time, during the first few centuries of Islam, it became obvious that many so-called hadith were in fact spurious sayings that had been fabricated for various motives, at best to encourage believers to act righteously and at worse to corrupt believers'' understanding of Islam and to lead them astray. Since Islamic legal scholars were utilizing hadith as an adjunct to the Qu''ran in their development of the Islamic legal system, it became critically important to have reliable collections of hadith. While the early collections of hadith often contained hadith that were of questionable origin, gradually collections of authenticated hadith called sahih were compiled. Such collections were made possible by the development of the science of hadith criticism, a science at the basis of which was a critical analysis of the chain of (oral) transmission (isnad) of the hadith going all the way back to Muhammad. The two most highly respected collections of hadith are the authenticated collections the Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. In addition to these, four other collections came to be well respected, although not to the degree of Bukhari and Muslim''s sahih collections. These four other collections are the Sunan of Tirmidhi, Nasa''i, Ibn Majah, and Abu Da''ud. Together these four and the two sahih collections are called the "six books" (al-kutub al-sitta). Two other important collections, in particular, are the Muwatta of Ibn Malik, the founder of the Maliki School of law, and the Musnad of Ahmad ibn Hanbal, the founder of the Hanbali School of law.</p><p>The third source that provides an important basis for the faith is the biography of the Prophet of God---Muhammad.  Muhammad ibnu Abdillah was born in Mecca in the year 569 CE. Orphaned at an early age, Muhammad was cared for by his uncle. He earned his living as a trader and a Shepard among the Bedouins, and was known by his people as al-amin (the trustworthy one).  When he was 25, he married Khadija.  When Muhammad reached the age of 40, the angel Gabriel came to him with revelations that established his prophethood. Muhammad was first ordered to instruct his immediate family on Islam, including his beloved wife Khadija, but eventually it was revealed to him that he should begin delivering the message to all of mankind.  In the next 20 years of his life, he communicated the message of Allah to his people, and set an example for how each human being should lead her or his life. This is especially valuable since Muhammad is the last Prophet of Allah. In the year 632, the year of his death, the Prophet delivered his famous last sermon.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>You may visit <a target="_new" href="http://www.TermPaperAdvisor.com">http://www.TermPaperAdvisor.com</a> and <a target="_new" href="http://www.TermPapersMadeEasy.com">http://www.TermPapersMadeEasy.com</a> for instant access to over 45,000 plus term papers and essays.

Although reluctant to leave their established communities, the high cost of oil,', '<p>The immigrant experience in the United States was one that consisted of a drastic transition in peasant life which uprooted citizens from their native villages.   Their villages served not only as their homes and workplaces, but as communities and as a way of identifying themselves as a people.  However, varying political and economic upheavals in their homelands caused them to seek out other options, as it came down to a matter of do or die for many, not a matter of choice.  Once in America, they had to struggle with the unfamiliarity and alienation that was thrust upon them in the New World.  The situation of uprootedness  was not limited to the English or Irish, but to peasants in other countries, as well, including the Italians, Chinese, and Mexicans.</p><p>The Italians fled from their villages in flocks of  millions at the end of the 19th century .  Although reluctant to leave their established communities, the high cost of oil, along with widespread starvation and cholera outbreaks forced them to make the trip overseas.#  Italians did not migrate out of their own volition, but rather because “Life was impossible here. …America has become a disease, but out of necessity.”  stated the president of an Italian agricultural society.#    They were forced to leave because there became no other options, although pamphlets, posters, and word-of-mouth did tell fantastic stories of the dazzling new life that awaited them in America. # Italian communities were uprooted suddenly, and many did not have time to make plans for their new lives in America.  After arriving in America, the peasants worlds were turned upside down, and many fostered warm affections toward the familiarity of  their home country.#</p><p>Similarly, the Chinese were driven out of their communities and into a world of alienation and isolation.  Chinese people were uprooted out of their communities through the waning Manchu government, and were forced to deal with the ridicule of Americans at their old practices and customs.   The white Americans paid little attention to them, and actually developed an animosity toward them as job competition ensued.#  Although they did not acculturate with American society, many of their festivals and rituals vanished from their lives while in America.  After death, many had their bones sent back overseas to China, since the funeral procession was one of the few traditions that they held onto, and didn’t want to be buried alongside their hostile American neighbors.#  The Chinese did not merely have their communities transplanted overseas, but rather had them abruptly ripped apart when settling over in America.</p><p>The Mexicans were forced to move out of their country after a chaotic series of political and economic uproars, caused primarily by the Mexican Revolution.#  The farm-workers and miners now lived in company-owned settlements in which every aspect of their lives were regulated, and some even considered it to be worse than the serfdom back home in Mexico.#  Although some did succumb to Americanization, most resisted the adoption of American culture and were adamant on keeping their Mexican heritage and ways.  Mexican children were only permitted to speak Spanish at home, and they retained close bonds with their close neighbors to the South.#  Prejudice and segregation were dominant themes in their lives, and they were described as an “illiterate, diseased, pauperized” people in an article.#  The Mexicans had their communities uprooted, and did not simply decide to move toward the unwelcoming lands of America out of choice.</p><p>The role of the village played a crucial role in the lives of people everywhere.  The shared community gave them a sense of security and power in their lives.  By saying that communities were uprooted, one is saying that these people were forced away from their homes and everything they’d ever known, and shoved into a completely unfamiliar territory. These people, not only Europeans, but also the Chinese, and Mexicans were forced to learn how to survive in an often unwelcoming foreign land.  They did not simply pick up and move voluntarily, but out of necessity of the situation.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>You may visit <a target="_new" href="http://www.TermPaperAdvisor.com">http://www.TermPaperAdvisor.com</a> and <a target="_new" href="http://www.TermPapersMadeEasy.com">http://www.TermPapersMadeEasy.com</a> for instant access to over 45,000 plus term papers and essays.

The English Corner! Read on to find out more', '<p>The first week of classes after the Spring Festival break have ended - eighteen classes of grade three, English majors. Next week I have twelve only! The schedule is strange. But, I''m not complaining for I have one class less than my contract states - sixteen a week. Though it''s two up, one week it''s also six down, the next.  Plus, I have nothing in the evenings.</p><p>Evenings have always been a strange time -and sacrosanct for me - private, and for whatever I want to do. And, I have my evenigs to myself when I can write, drink, watch or just lose myself ion my thoughts.</p><p>Strange - I call evenings strange because I am sort of moody then, most times. Does that have something to do with the tides, the moon or whatever? I don''t know and have never cared to discover. Perhaps, I will now.</p><p>Friday evening is English corner time at my university. It''s the time when students gather around the fountain in the university campus and converse in English , or at least, try to. Many end up looking for their soul mates because this is one place where opporsites meet, attract or are attracted and boding begins.</p><p>The English corner is also a place where English is cornered. English is cornered in the hearts and minds of students who realize that it''s an important tool to further their careers. Most times, students in China are too wary of using English. Some are shy and most are scared of losing face. Making a mistake that is noticed by others entail a loss of face for the speaker. Not undersdtanding what another has said and to be found to have not understood is another occasion for loss of face.</p><p>At the English corner, impressions are made, friendships begun and romance courted. It''s also a place where the ''foreign teachers'' are actually cornered. They, the foreign teachers, surrounded by dozens of students, and sometimes more, are occasionally bombarded with inane questions that are repeated dozens of times in the space of less than a dozen minutes.</p><p>Most foreign teachers smile and grin and bear. Sometimes, the questions shot, relate to politics of the foreign teacher''s country, their social problems and the like - essentially, questions that may be embarrassing to answer, especially to those who have been fed on a limited diet of news and information. School text books often have pieces about other countries. Generally, the material tends to portray other countries in a poor light. Why, you might ask. The answer is - something innate in human nature and its politics.</p><p>Questions like why did you come here are par for the course. The tone, sometimes, suggests, ''Go back to where you came from''. ''What was your job at home'' is passable but not when it''s followed by a ''what was your salary there?''</p><p>''Do you like China?'' is a question that expects just one answer -''yes''!</p><p>''What do you like about China?'' is grilling, continued.</p><p>To be fair, there is really nothing wrong with some of those questions if the answers were not met with a nod that seems to agree but a tone and demeanour that seems to say ''I know more than you reveal. You are lying.''</p><p>Yet, foreign teachers, often troop to the English corners, especially if there is one at their own institution. Most schools and colleges/universities tend to have one of their own, in addition to sundry ones organized by eager-for-a-money-making-opportunity businessmen. Some resauranteurs and coffee-house owners organize such ''events'' in their premises and lure foreigners with promises of regular income but deliver nothing when they find that clients are reluctant to drop in, except in larger cities where some denizens seem to have more money than they can spend.</p><p>Often, people befriend foreigners and invite them to dinners and lunches as a means of showing off a trophy, for that is what foreigners often are in China. The deep-rooted culture, distrust of foreigners and an unwilingness to share information ensure that foreigners remain aliens. It is nearly impossible for foreigners to actually integrate into the mainstream society, regardless of the number of years spent. Therefore, unbeknownst to them, they are invited, offered the best seats at a dinner table (the one facing the door) but treated with a subterranean contempt.</p><p>There is a growing belief (amongst the Chinese) that most foreigners who come to teach in China are those that have few skills or none and end up in China where all they can teach is their mother-tongue, English - and, sometimes, not even that. As a result, contempt for foreigners is growing.</p><p>For long, the foreign teachers have lorded over their less informed and apparently pea-brained wards and counterparts.\r But, things are beginning to even out and contempt is met with  equal contempt.</p><p>It''s a matter of time before the scales tilt the other way and the stream of foreigners that landed in China to sample its exotic culture and lifestyle will either run dry or come for purely economic reasons.</p><p>Until then, the English corner will continue to thrive, where foreigners will tend to feel progressively more cornered and less sure of themselves, where uneasy questions will continue to be flung and unbelieving interrogators nod while they neither believe nor tell that they don''t believe.</p><p>It''s Friday evening, nearing the English corner hour at my university and my sacrosanct private time is ready to be thrown to the toothless sharks!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Rajesh Kanoi (Jack) is a published writer, now living and working in China.

You may, however, attend any educational establishment in the country provided both the establishment and the program of your choice are listed by the assistance office in your province.</p><p>There are several different types of funding for post secondary education that include grants and bursaries (which you wouldn’t have to pay back) but there are 2 main types of student loan – the Federal and Provincial programs. Whichever type of loan you wish to apply for it all has to be started off by applying to the Provincial/Territorial Assistance office for the Province you are officially a resident of.</p><p>The main attraction of a student loan is that although they are REAL loans that do have to be repaid, they are interest free while you remain enrolled in an eligible education program. Once you graduate/leave education the repayment terms are set (normally low interest and you agree the repayment term) and you begin to pay them back. Banks and other lending establishments are no longer involved in offering new loans as all funding is provided by the federal or provincial governments.</p><p>Quebec, Northwest Territories and Nunavut are NOT involved in the Canada Student Loans program and have their own systems. If you are a resident of one of these 3 provinces or Territories then you need to contact the particular office for that Province.</p><p>To start the ball rolling with the application for a loan there are several processes that you should consider. Your eligibility is the most important – both you (the applicant) and the course you wish to undertake must meet the criteria laid down.</p><p>The applicant: The main factor of eligibility is whether you are intending to be a full or part time student.

If you are from Ontario or Saskatchewan then you would make one payment back to the NSLSC which would cover the total amount borrowed from both the federal and provincial programs.</p><p>The course you wish to enroll on must be listed on the Master List of Designated educational Institutions – it is strongly advised that you ensure the establishment you wish to attend is recognized by your provincial provider and the course choices meet the necessary requirements before you commit to it. This also applies if you wish to attend an overseas establishment.</p><p>Your personal financial status will determine the amount of assistance you will be offered with the Federal loan system covering up to 60% of the total you are assessed as needing and the provincial system contributing up to the remaining 40%. Your “needs” are assessed by the provincial office when you apply as they handle the initial application and will forward you the loan documents. Once the Provincial or territorial Student Assistance office has received and processed your application, it will establish the amount of loan you are entitled to apply for and carry out credit checks.

A perfect example of this is back in the late 70s to early 80s when computers started becoming a part of business.  True, they were crude in comparison to today''s models but they still had a function in many businesses.  Back then, if you were just a college graduate you could be trained in the field of computers if that''s what you wanted.  As a matter of fact, data processing was a common field for many math majors to go into.</p><p>Today, it is a different story.  There are college graduates who can''t get jobs, let alone one in data processing because their field of major is not highly sought after.  For example, political science majors have a hard time finding work unless they plan to go on to law school.  Many end of working at fast food restaurants because that is all they can find.</p><p>The truth is, years ago, very few people went to college.  Usually only the very rich or the very smart.  A child who wasn''t all that bright wasn''t expected to go to college.  He or she could easily go to a trade school and take up machine shop or auto shop and become a mechanic.  For that matter back in the good old days a high school graduate with good grades could easily get a job at a bank or an insurance company and work their way up to manager within a few years.</p><p>Today, without a college education your chances of employment are limited at best.  Today, everyone goes to college.  Students who aren''t academically gifted are pushed through by programs like No Child Left Behind and there are many colleges for them to go to that are really no more than glorified high schools.  The skills that they learn at these colleges are things that they should have learned in high school.</p><p>And therein lies the problem with today''s colleges.  With affirmative action and no child left behind, college curriculums are watered down to accommodate the less academically gifted child.  Thus, the college education itself just isn''t worth what it was years ago.  Add to that the fact that college tuition is through the roof and even after getting a degree you''re not guaranteed to get a job, the benefits of having a college degree itself are just not what they were.  Many students are left with debts that they can''t pay off because they can''t find work.</p><p>This is not to suggest that a student should not go to college.  Certainly the opportunities for a child without a college degree are close to non existent.  A student just needs to know that the piece of paper itself just isn''t worth what it used to be worth.  A student needs to go the extra mile.  A masters degree, which at one time was truly optional, is now pretty much a requirement.  Also, a student should pick something that is going to be practical and in demand.

The traditional way and your main scholarship will be from good grades.  There is no getting around that.  A student at the top of his or her class with good SAT scores, when accepted to a college will most likely get a full or at least partial scholarship to the school of their choice.  Of course a lot of this has to do with the school itself.  The more elite schools will have stricter requirements for giving out scholarships.  For example, a student applying to a county college may get a full scholarship for being number one or two in the class while that same student when applying to an Ivy League school may only get a partial scholarship or none at all.  But again, good grades and SAT scores are only part of the equation.</p><p>The next part of the equation is economic need.  There are many organizations who provide funds for students to go to school who simply can''t afford it.  The main organization for this is FAFSA.  A student''s first step in financing their education should be to file an application for financial aid with FAFSA.  You can get an application for this at any college office or fill one out online.  After filing, their program will immediately tell you, based on your reported income, how much money you will be expected to pay towards your child''s education.  For example, if your child is going to a school that is going to cost $30,000 a year and the FAFSA application says you are responsible for $20,000 then that means you should be getting $10,000 in aid from the government after you have submitted the paperwork to them with your school expenses.</p><p>Does that mean you''re stuck with paying $20,000 for your kid''s education? Not at all.  Even if the college itself doesn''t give your child any money, there are plenty of other places to get funds from.</p><p>Go to your local library or do an online search.  You will find literally hundreds of private organizations that offer scholarships for students.  Each one has different requirements but they all usually fall into one of several criteria.</p><p>The first criteria is that some of these organizations offer scholarships based on grades and SAT scores.  In these cases, simply submit this information to the organization.  They will get back to you and let you know if you''re going to get a scholarship.</p><p>Some organizations base scholarships on essays.  They pick out the students who wrote the best essays and these are the ones who get scholarships.  There may be three scholarship awards for these essay contests.</p><p>Then there are organizations that offer scholarships based on some affiliation that you have such as if you had a family member who fought in a foreign war.  Then there are organizations like the Masons, Elks and Rotary, that offer scholarships if a family member is part of their organization.  Most of these organizations are districted and usually give out only one or two scholarships per district.</p><p>So, as you can see, there are more ways for your kid to get money for college besides just getting good grades.  But they do help.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="109" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Michael-Russell_10500.jpg" border="0" alt="Michael Russell - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p><br>\r -------------------------------------------------------<br>\r Michael Russell<br>\r Your Independent guide to <a target="_new" href="http://college-facts.com/">College</a><br>\r -------------------------------------------------------<br></p><!--UdmComment-->');

Go to college and live on campus.  The chance to get away from Mom and Dad.  No more, "Do your chores," "Eat your veggies," and all the other things that come with living at home.  Then the kid finally leaves, sets up housekeeping and then...BAM! He''s calling home to Mommy because he''s homesick.  Happens to everyone.  Fortunately, there are some things you can do as a student to keep from wanting to run back home to your parents.</p><p>For starters, get involved! There are plenty of school activities you can do.  Most colleges have fraternities and other social groups that are the core of on campus life.  Just look at the campus calendar or newspaper and you''re bound to find a ton of things covering a number of interests.  Go to a concert.  Attend a sporting event.  Just don''t sit around in your dorm room.</p><p>Outside of campus activities, there are also those things that you yourself enjoy doing.  Got a hobby?  Bring it with you to the campus.  Maybe it''s even something that your roommate and you can share together.  Bring some books if you like to read.  That''s always a great way to kill time, especially if you''re reading something like "Lord Of The Rings".</p><p>Another thing that will keep you busy and also be quite beneficial is to get organized.  Don''t just let your college experience happen.  Plan as many things as you can.  Keep a datebook.  Make sure you keep track of all homework assignments, tests and papers that are due and when.  The last thing you want is to walk into class and realize that you had a test scheduled for that day and you forgot all about it.  Don''t trust your memory.</p><p>Make friends and make time to go out with them.  Most campuses have local ice cream shops or other retail places where you can hang out and have a good time.  Making friends will also make you realize that these kids are going through the same things that you''re going through and they probably miss their parents as well.</p><p>Need something else to keep your mind off your problems? Volunteer.  There has to be a student who could use some help with a tough course.  Maybe they have a local radio station or some other activity you can volunteer your time to.  Nobody will turn down help if you offer it for free.</p><p>And of course the number one thing on your list is to keep in touch with your family.  All of a sudden, that little sister who used to drive you crazy isn''t such a terrible person any more.  Give her and your parents a call or write them a long letter.  Let them know what you''re doing at school and how things are going.  If you miss them, tell them you do.</p><p>This is a great time to realize just how much you really love your family and at the same time embark on a part of your life that you''ll look back on someday with a great big smile.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="109" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Michael-Russell_10500.jpg" border="0" alt="Michael Russell - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p><br>\r -------------------------------------------------------<br>\r Michael Russell<br>\r Your Independent guide to <a target="_new" href="http://college-facts.com/">College</a><br>\r -------------------------------------------------------<br></p><!--UdmComment-->');

College can be tough.  With the way most high schools are now spoon feeding kids and almost pushing them through, college can be a real wake up call.  So how does a student survive the reality check that he gets when starting his college education?</p><p>The first thing that a student can do to prepare for his college education is to plan ahead.  Write to the college for a catalogue.  Get a list of courses offered.  Get a handbook.  Go to the admissions office.  Get as much information about the college you plan to attend so you can prepare yourself for what lies ahead.</p><p>Check out any organizations the college has such as special clubs or support services.  Knowing where to go based on what you need can save you a lot of time and anxiety.</p><p>Before you enrol, go to the campus.  Pay them a visit.  Meet with your financial aid councillor.  Go to admissions.  Meet with anyone you can who can help you get situated in your new surroundings especially the department chair of the major you''re planning.</p><p>Make sure you give yourself a tour of the whole campus.  It''s good to know where everything is in advance.  This way you''re not looking for things last minute and driving yourself crazy trying to find them.</p><p>When registration day comes, relax.  These days are always long, boring and frustrating.  These days are chaos for everyone involved, not just the students.  Just know that there are others going through the same thing as you.</p><p>Don''t be afraid to meet and get to know other students.  There are going to be a lot of strange faces.  You''re going to want to make friends because college can be a lonely experience if you try to go it alone.  These kids are all in the same boat as you.  Right there you already have something in common.</p><p>In the first couple of weeks of classes take the time to meet with all your teachers.  Let them know what you expect to get out of their classes.  Show them that you are really serious about your education.  If they see this that will make their relationship with you much stronger right from the start.  Having a teacher in your corner puts you ahead of the game.</p><p>When given an assignment, give yourself plenty of time to complete it.  Don''t leave things for the last minute.  College work can pile up on you very fast.  By starting assignments right away you give yourself the best chance of not getting buried in your work.</p><p>Finally, allow yourself to be a human being.  Nobody is expecting you to be superman.  Many students try too hard to fit in by joining every social club they can.  By taking on too much you''re only going to wear yourself out.  If you want to do something then do it.  But don''t do it just to be "one of the boys".</p><p>By following the above tips you give yourself the best chance of getting through college in one piece and with all your marbles.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="109" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Michael-Russell_10500.jpg" border="0" alt="Michael Russell - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p><br>\r -------------------------------------------------------<br>\r Michael Russell<br>\r Your Independent guide to <a target="_new" href="http://college-facts.com/">College</a><br>\r -------------------------------------------------------<br></p><!--UdmComment-->');

The accelerating proportion of students with term-time jobs rose from 47% to 58% in the recent decades. According to the new research, students spend less time in the classrooms than they used to 10 years ago.</p><p>Learning and earning have become the norm for a good chunk of students, especially for those who are in financial need. As long as most government loans and bursary programs provide the minimum funds to cover the tuition costs, students have to eat, catch the occasional movies and remain on the fringe of fashion. Proverbially term-time working kills two birds with one stone – it pays the bills while allowing students to gain invaluable work experience.</p><p>It really stands for some reason, because combining work and school offers benefits beyond just earning the keep. However, the overwhelming number of students has to work, because they need money for basic essentials. The figures show that 80% of students can’t manage on their students loans, another 20% are bound to work simply because their families can’t support them or just because they don’t want building up debts.</p><p>A recent study found that that term-time employment has detrimental consequences for students, both in terms of their social experience and academic performance. Working students miss out on everyday experiences of college or university.</p><p>They skip lectures and seminars; spend less time in libraries, using their university’s computing facilities, devote less time to studying independently, reading, and preparing their assignments because of their jobs. 42% of students reported that working hurt their grades and limited their class choice. At the same time, 63% reported that they wouldn’t be able to afford college if they didn’t work.</p><p>The employed students work an average of 25 hours per week, earning roughly $7.50 per hour, mostly in unskilled jobs unrelated to their courses. Even having a full course load, the majority of students work that much, straining themselves with irregular shifts and insufficient sleep, feeling fatigued and exhausted during the classes. It results in declining of students’ academic performance and persistence, and raises the likelihood of students being dropped out. But for all that, working students usually can’t afford vacations, because holiday time equals extra work time.</p><p>While evidence shows that a slew of students work at levels that negatively influence the quality of their studying and their academic achievement, they can’t afford to cut back their jobs.  All in all, rising academic costs and failure of the government to keep pace have forced the majority of students to work a number of hours that negatively impacts their academic performance.</p><p>However, term-time working is not only about negative influence and making sacrifice. It is also about pleasure and gaining invaluable working experience.</p><p>Many students agree in opinion that part-time working is beneficial and claim that they are able to handle their work and studying, enjoying the process, and feeling incentive and motivation to study in overloaded time-schedule. It is also an effective way to discover what types of jobs students like, and more likely to engage in after graduation. A host of students believes that working is an excellent opportunity to acquire practical skills and knowledge, and to feel a sense of achievement and accomplishment.</p><p>Though, working leaves little time for a broader learning experience the majority of students infer to receive at colleges and universities, and apply at their jobs.

You look at the calendar and think you''ve got plenty of time to prepare for what comes next.  It couldn''t be further from the truth and here''s why.</p><p>In your last year of college this is where you''re doing your final research project for your major.  Depending on what that major is, it can be a real whopper.  For example, if you''re a marketing major, your assignment may be to research a company from the ground up and report on how it became successful.  You may also be asked to design a fictional company and market it from square one.  Whatever the assignment you can be assured that it will be very time consuming.  You won''t have as much free time to prepare for life after college as you think.  Therefore it is a good idea to start on several things as early as possible so that they don''t pile up on you.</p><p>The first thing is deciding what comes after college.  You basically have two choices here.  You can either continue your education by going for a masters degree or you can decide that a BA is good enough and go out looking for a job.</p><p>In the case of the former you don''t want to start applying for colleges at the end of your last semester or you may find that your advanced education career isn''t going to start when you''d like.  Most colleges have deadlines for applications and they''re long before your last semester is over.  So start applying for colleges early.  If the college you''re attending has its own masters program and you plan to register, make sure you do this early.  Even though you may be a current student your college also has deadlines.  You don''t want to miss them.</p><p>In the case of the latter where you''ve decided that you''ve had enough of school and want to get a job, you still want to get a jump on this.  For starters, employers look favorably on students who start sending in applications early.  This shows the prospective employer that the student is serious about his future, and many times a student will get a job just because he applied to the company early.</p><p>Also, you want to make sure that you make a list of companies you want to apply to.  Finding a job can be a long process and sometimes you can go on fifty interviews before you find something.  You''re going to need all the time you can get to not only get applications for these companies but also to do the research on them.  You don''t want to go into an interview cold.  You want to be able to tell the H.R.  person something about the company so they can see you did your homework.  This can sometimes mean the difference between getting a job or not.</p><p>Finally, you want to start on your résumé right away.  Printers take a long time to get these together.  Plus, there is lots of proofreading that needs to be done.  You don''t want to save this for the last minute.</p><p>By following these few simple tips, you can make your last year of college go a lot smoother.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="109" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Michael-Russell_10500.jpg" border="0" alt="Michael Russell - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p><br>\r -------------------------------------------------------<br>\r Michael Russell<br>\r Your Independent guide to <a target="_new" href="http://college-facts.com/">College</a><br>\r -------------------------------------------------------<br></p><!--UdmComment-->');

Men need not apply.</p><p>Sadly, only 2.5% of all women attend women''s colleges.  What may surprise you however is that they account for 24% of the United States Congress membership and one-third of the board membership of fortune 500 companies.  Not too shabby.</p><p>The reason we even have women''s colleges is because in the mid 1800s all male colleges refused to allow women to attend and therefore they had no place to go and no chance for a higher education.  So women opened up their own colleges.  It wasn''t easy.  They met with a lot of resistance.  Those against these colleges argued that they couldn''t properly prepare women for the difficult jobs that needed to be done.  Also, it was believed that because of a woman''s biology, she wouldn''t be able to withstand the strain of a college education.  Boy, were we a backward people.</p><p>But supporters of the women''s movement, and there were plenty of them, made it so that a women''s college became a reality and since that time the graduates of these institutions have not only succeeded but have excelled beyond anyone''s expectations.</p><p>According to independent studies the following benefits to be gained by attending a women''s college have been reported.</p><p>1.  Women are given the opportunity to participate more because the class sizes are smaller.  This creates a more positive learning experience because of the individualized attention that the women get.</p><p>2.  Women who attend these colleges have a higher level of self esteem.  It is reported that 9 out of 10 women give their colleges high marks for developing their self confidence and preparing them for the outside world.</p><p>3.  According to surveys, women who attend a women''s college get more out of the college experience than women who go to mixed schools and develop academically at a faster pace.</p><p>4.  It is a fact that women who attend a women''s college are more likely to graduate than women who go to a mixed school.  They are also more likely to earn advanced Master and Doctorate degrees.</p><p>5.  Women also earn more after graduation because they usually choose traditionally male careers.  They graduate at a higher rate than the women who go to mixed schools and are thus more likely to get these higher paying jobs.</p><p>Ironically, the original purpose of a women''s college was simply to train women to be better wives and mothers.  But as women became more educated the roles of these colleges changed to preparing them for exciting and rewarding careers alongside their male counterparts.</p><p>Currently, there are 78 women''s colleges in the United States alone and colleges for women are popping up all over the world.  It may have one time been a man''s world but with the existence of women''s colleges and the opportunities that women are now afforded because of them, women have now taken their rightful place right alongside their male counterparts.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="109" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Michael-Russell_10500.jpg" border="0" alt="Michael Russell - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p><br>\r -------------------------------------------------------<br>\r Michael Russell<br>\r Your Independent guide to <a target="_new" href="http://college-facts.com/">College</a><br>\r -------------------------------------------------------<br></p><!--UdmComment-->');

You''ve decided you want to go to college.  The question is, which one?  How do you decide where you want to go?  There are so many colleges to choose from sometimes the choice can be a tough one to make.  You may be in a situation where you live in an area that contains a number of colleges and all good ones.  How do you decide which is the best for you?  What follows is a brief guide that hopefully will make the process a little easier.</p><p>When deciding on which college to apply to, which doesn''t guarantee you will get in, the first thing that must be considered above all others is what it is you want to do with your life.  The major you choose will, or at least, should greatly influence the college you choose.  For example, if you have decided that you want to major in communications and someday be a radio announcer you don''t want to pick a college that specializes in medicine and has a substandard communications program at best.  This would be very counter productive.  Naturally applying to a school that is famous for a special area is going to mean you''re going to have a lot of competition and getting in might not be so easy, especially if they only have a limited number of openings.  That is the reason we always have backup choices.  But imagine if you did get into that specialty school for what you wanted to do.  Your chances of getting a job in that field have just increased by numbers too large to measure.  So go for the best school you can find for what you want to do, but always have a backup plan.</p><p>Another thing that needs to be taken into consideration is cost.  Unfortunately we live in a world where education can be quite expensive.  If you''re not entitled to financial aid or don''t have the grades for a scholarship then your choices for college may be limited to what you can afford.  It shouldn''t be your first priority but you should keep in mind the cost of your education and what you can pay for without putting a great burden on your finances.</p><p>Another thing that should be considered when choosing a college is location.  If the college you want to attend is not close to home you are going to have to prepare for the possibility that you''re going to have to live on campus.  This is going to raise the cost of your education and needs to be taken into account.  Another thing that needs to be taken into consideration regarding location is how safe a neighborhood it is.  Unfortunately, some colleges are not in the best areas.  So security of the campus needs to be checked out.  You want to make sure your college experience is a safe one.</p><p>By concentrating on just those three simple things you can more easily decide where you ultimately want to go to school.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="109" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Michael-Russell_10500.jpg" border="0" alt="Michael Russell - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p><br>\r -------------------------------------------------------<br>\r Michael Russell<br>\r Your Independent guide to <a target="_new" href="http://college-facts.com/">College</a><br>\r -------------------------------------------------------<br></p><!--UdmComment-->');

Focus on your classes, activities, friends, and family. Take time to relax. Any period of intense work requires time for relaxation and reflection.</p><p>Mock interview – prepare by having friends or relatives interview you, rehearse the answers that you give, listen to criticism regarding your answer, how fast you talk, the gestures \r you make while taking. All these can help you be better prepared and not surprised or shocked the day of your college interview.

If you have good questions you also have a good chance of impressing the interviewer by showing you have initiative and that you also have some criteria for the place you will be spending the next few years in.</p><p>Dress in advance – have your outfit ready a couple of days before the college interview, know what you will have on, and choose items that you like and that make you feel good.</p><p>Final word – remember that these are only people that are sitting on the other side of that table, they were once like you, going to college, filling in endless application forms and getting ready for interviews. Making a mistake does not mean that it’s the end of the line for you, you can always show that you have the ability to land on your feet, to acknowledge your mistakes and to go on, in spite of making an evident mistake here and there, these are mature people who will appreciate it, they are looking for someone who will fight to get a chance, and that will not crack under pressure, if you had something go wrong in the interview – get to work on repairing the damage immediately, do not wait, do not delay the thoughts for the night, but react and recover, say something honest and funny, show willingness to work things out and solve them by hard work, but never, never, give up.

Go suck a camel''s nut. No, seriously, stop reading. This guide ain''t for you. You piss Joe off.</p><p>Still here? Fine. The less privileged among us recognize college as the gateway to something we REALLY want: Money. After all, anybody with MONEY can get all the sex and liquor they can handle. Education is coin, plain and simple. You''ve got to keep your priorities straight. When a guy (or gal) has been living with a 3/4 empty gas tank long enough, he (or she) really understands the value of a dime, and if you want to make piles of them, a college degree is your must-have ticket.</p><p>So how do you think you can do it, smart guy? Got straight As and think you''ve got a financial plan to bootstrap yourself into the ivy league? Yeah, right.</p><p>"Well, Joe, what about getting scholarships?" Glad you asked. Scholarships. Sure, if you can figure out where to apply. Or you could PAY someone to research scholarships for you - plenty of services do this for a fee. You could also drive to Kansas, find a farm, and feed your money to a jackass.</p><p>Unfortunately, scholarships also require you to meet qualifications, such as having an exemplary record full of glowing commendations by your peers and civil leaders. Being "a minority" (apparently this means everybody except white males) usually helps. The local "Brotherhood of the Duckbilled Platypus Lodge" might kick you a few hundred bucks, too -- which could cover your share of the rent for a month ... maybe.</p><p>"Okay, Joe, but I can also get a grant!" Yeah, if you''re poor enough the government might chuck you a few thousand dollars per year. Try going to school on THAT and it''ll pay for your college in, oh, about 20 years. Good luck feeding yourself in the meantime.</p><p>Not that scholarships and grants are a bad thing, every crumpled fiver will help you enormously when you visit the local Albertson''s for a big case of discount ramen noodles, but in today''s world of $40-$70,000 colleges, we need something else. What we need are new roads to follow -- college paths for the rest of us.</p><p>The Non-Traditional Routes: Fast and Cheap</p><p>Fastest way to a degree? Testing. Testing. And more testing, until you are a crowned champion of the multiple choice quiz. Added benefit of testing your way to all or part of a degree? That''s easy: money. A $60 proctored exam is cheaper than a $525 3-semester hour (credit) course.</p><p>....if, that is, the test were only worth 3 credits. Most are worth more, and the true kings of the college-credit tests are worth a whopping 30 credits each! These two tests are the GRE general equivalency exams and are quite a bit to swallow at any one time.</p><p>Here are the tests accepted most anywhere:</p><p>CLEP -- College Level Examination Program, probably the most standard batch of tests. Taking the general areas alone will knock 30 credits off your degree. Great place to start. Miss a few test areas, miss a few credits. You still come out ahead.</p><p>GRE -- Graduate Record Examinations, come in two flavors, the massive general equivalency tests and the smaller subject area tests. Take the easy subject area tests and watch the credits fall off your degree. You only need to get about 60% of the questions right to pass.</p><p>DANTES -- Military folks are already familiar with these tests. The DANTES'' DSSTs (DANTES Subject Standardized Tests) are to college credits what a weed-wacker is to a field of fluffy dandelions. Have fun.</p><p>You can take these tests at any proctored testing center, found in any populated area. Check your phone book. If you''ve got a community college in town or in the NEXT town, try there. Got squat? In completely ''rural'' areas most schools will allow a priest, military officer, notary public, or other "responsible" individual to proctor a written version of the exam. It''s kind of like the honor system. Play nice.</p><p>Need to know what tests to take? Keep reading.</p><p>Cheap college: Think DETC (http://www.detc.org/) approved schools. Many of these schools have extremely cheap credits (on order of $50 bucks a credit). Check ''em out and fill in the gaps in your education. One good key is to look for schools approved for VA (veteran''s) benefits -- these "discount" schools are often a cut above the rest. Caveat: Buy beware! Many school''s DETC credits cannot be transferred to another institution. Do your homework first and give your "finishing school" a call to make sure they''ll accept you and your discount education.</p><p>Players You Should Know</p><p>The biggest supporters of the fast and cheap methods are the finishing schools - the places that actually issue your degree. Once you''ve scrapped together all the credits you can from every place you can think of, these are the schools to take them to and cash them in (no residency requirements or pesky entry tests here, folks). Collectively, they''re known as The Big Three: Thomas Edison college in Jersey, Excelsior (formerly Regents) college of New York, and Charter Oak of Connecticut. Not sure which tests to take? Start with the general education requirements (usually around 55 credits) that are standard to all degrees. Your degree will tell you what you need.</p><p>For example, take a basic list of requirements for a BA from Thomas Edison College (http://www.tesc.edu/prospective/undergraduate/degree/ba.php) and find tests which fulfill them, such as the Humanities CLEP, DSST Art of the Western World, and DSST An Introduction to the Modern Middle East for the 12 required humanities credits. Three afternoons, $180, and $1920 or more saved -- not even counting the saved time.</p><p>For other requirements, see the B.A. Major Area of study PDF files (ie. the economics PDF for a major in economics from T. Edison) that will tell you exactly what courses you need to test out of for your degree. All schools provide similar degree requirement lists. Pick your winner.</p><p>The Scams...Don''t Get Burned</p><p>There''s a whole industry out there waiting to cater to the guy/gal who thinks an accredited degree is out of reach, and two main types of customers -- those who pay somebody else to do it, and those who do it themselves. We have a word for the first group: Suckers. Here''s the word for the second: Con-artists.</p><p>The suckers do searches online for fake degrees and usually end up someplace like Rochville, Belford or Almeda browsing fees.</p><p>Note that these places do not come right out and say they''re selling fake degrees. What they''re selling is "alternatively accredited" degrees -- ie, degrees accredited by some institution (such as the IAOUU, UCOEA, or the AOAEx) that is by no means approved of by the United States'' (or anybody else''s) government, or even degrees that are simply "life-experience" degrees. WTF is that? If an employer cared more about your "life-experience" than a piece of paper, people wouldn''t need to go out and fake one in the first place.</p><p>Keep away from anyplace that isn''t properly accredited. All they want is your money, and all you''ll get is a piece of paper worth LESS than the ink it''s printed on.</p><p>The Military Option: Nuke ''em All\r Join the military for four years. Get the GI Bill. Get your college degree. Just like your author. Smooth like Joe, baby. All the best!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Joe</p><p><a target="_new" href="http://www.joescollegeguide.com">http://www.joescollegeguide.com</a></p><!--UdmComment-->');

Because that is one major problem with academia they are so busy proving themselves right all the time that they come to the wrong conclusion and deny actual observation. Perhaps you may wish to review your comments, as one might think that they indeed have a touch of academia rhetoric and borderline on BS sometimes actually. You know one might think that?”</p><p>The researcher then states; “Since I did reply to several comments as this conversation expanded, I would like to state for the record, that though the viewpoints are intriguing, we may find ourselves investing more time discussing branch details, than managing the root of this topic.”</p><p>Again the researcher continues to remain in denial to fact and observation instead wishing to re-define and then go do experimentation without even considering the observations. In fact the researcher is border lining on academic fraud in purporting that we throw away our observations for some other new set of proofs, which indeed the researcher “debunker” driven parasite academic will create. In fact all this fancy schmancy scientific terminology is for not if one is to deny what they observe. In fact although to the researchers credit they did reply to a few posts on the online think tank forum board, it was more of this same sort of nothing-ness here and basically a complete waste of time and proof of total incompetence of the subject matter. Such a researcher is a fraud and nothing they discuss can be accepted as genuine research. It is all nothing more than Bull Sh_t. However another think tanker called the researcher onto the carpet and stated:</p><p>“There is no root topic to discuss as I see it; humans are animals. If your root question is “what makes humans unique?” well then I think the question is flawed, because there is not anything other than the current success of the species that would make them unique as they have infested the planet. Additionally you know much of evolution is luck.”</p><p>Next the researcher states: “Let me assure you however that “what I am not asking…” is for you to withhold your comments or input on the subject. Simply said, I would like to get down to business with the data calculations.”</p><p>Other think tanker; “There is nothing to calculate unless you want to start measuring brain density of animals and humans, DNA similarities and differences (in both animals and humans), and behavior in natural environments. Much of this has already been done almost to the point of over kill.”</p><p>The researcher next states; “Since you have provided here a good starting point, I have to ask. Are we evaluating this problem at upper most level? Will the results satisfy the problem in question?”</p><p>Other think tanker’ “I had discussed all the observations and knowledge in my personal realm, as well as the main researchers in the field and it seems obvious that if one is to classify what people consider higher-order mammals as animals, then too, humans will fall into that category. But if one purposely sets out to define what human is in a separate category one has cheated, boondoggled and coerced data into a specific category to prove yourself right that humans are unique, which they are not; in fact no evidence suggests they are. And by redefining parameters one would be lying and cheating data. In fact you have completely wasted my time with dribble and bull, not a single shred of evidence that you even know what you are talking about, convincing me that you are a complete and utter fraud and another academic faker. Now then let me sound off: Of course liars figure and figures lie and humans are unique in that they are best of all groupings at lying. If that is science, have fun with it.”</p><p>Perhaps as a reader of this dialogue you can see the problems with researchers getting in the way of and blocking truth, pretending to have knowledge when they do not and problems with academic fraud. So working the problem backwards to show man is unique, does what? Helps mankind feel good about them selves? Celebrate being human? What is the point in this? Many people look to the animal kingdom and say; “boy those animals are dumb.” Yet, what is the animal’s function? They are filling out their niche and indeed probably doing it very well. In fact probably much better than mankind in his dysfunctional world judging by this dialogue and denial of reality based observations by supposed learned men.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="63" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Lance-Winslow_4195.jpg" border="0" alt="Lance Winslow - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>"Lance Winslow" - Online <a target="_new" href="http://www.WorldThinkTank.net/wttbbs/">Think Tank</a> forum board.

Of course Jane Goodall''s work and her first insights decades ago in studying chimpanzee troops shocked the core of the human belief system and religious thoughts of the day. Still some folks still believe that humans are unique to all other animals due to the fact that they have empathy. That simply is not so. Recently I had written a piece on this fact and it ended up becoming a major topic in an online think tank when another researcher of animal behavior stated:</p><p>“When I first read this short document, I realized that the problem in question is not necessarily the result of improper classification but rather the result of discriminatory endeavors influenced by peoples own adopted standards.”</p><p>Indeed and I wrote it after a coffee shop conversation and was miffed at the ignorance of a religious follower purporting information as fact which was completely bogus, arrogant and silly. And indeed he was using this, as the main basis for his argument that man has a soul, is divine made in the image of God [his particular god of course] and the only intelligent life in the Universe; you know that is just pure and utter hokum. I think we need to enlighten some of these folks and have them face up to the realities if we are to continue the forward progression of mankind, because you cannot build upon lie after lie and get to a potential understanding of the entire system from quantum physics to gravity, time and space. And we should.</p><p>The fellow thinker and animal behavioral researcher also stated; “Under measurement, “empathy” would fall into a category group shared with other living creatures. The notable differences being the degree or level of this characteristic within our social framework.”</p><p>Yes, I agree for the “empathy” portion of the research, this emotional behavior trait indeed falls into that realm, with varying degrees of individual species and in each species “Ranges” for instance the “hippie Chimps” now in the news, which are endangered and feared 5000 or less would have a greater degree of empathy than other breeds of chimpanzees. Sea Lions, seals, Dolphins will also be high on this trait. This is definitely something humans might wish to consider if they believe empathy is unique to humankind. So, think on this in 2006.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="63" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Lance-Winslow_4195.jpg" border="0" alt="Lance Winslow - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>"Lance Winslow" - Online <a target="_new" href="http://www.WorldThinkTank.net/wttbbs/">Think Tank</a> forum board.

Find out the best route between your residence hall, classes and activities. Take the safest route, not the fastest.</p><p>2.	Don’t become distracted when walking alone.  Keep the cell, i-pod, or other devices in your bag until you reach your destination.  Contrary to popular believe, talking on the cell does not prevent an attacker from picking you.  You become a prime target because you’re being distracted and your guard is down.</p><p>3.	Travel in groups of two or more at night and always walk in well-lit, heavily traveled areas. Walk facing traffic so you’re never pulled-up upon unexpectedly.</p><p>4.	Stay on sidewalks and away from shrubs, dark alleys, and doorways.</p><p>5.	Make sure to share your class and activity schedule with friends and family.</p><p>6.	When you go out, let someone know where you are going and when you plan to come back.</p><p>7.	Know where the emergency telephones are located. Program your cell phone''s speed dial with emergency numbers that include family and friends and keep it with you.</p><p>8.	Use shuttle buses after dark. If buses have stopped running, call the Escort Service or a taxi for a ride.  Your life is worth the cab fare.</p><p>9.	Wherever you are, stay alert to your surroundings and the actions of people around you…even at a party.  Do not wander off alone with anyone.  Keep around groups of friends. Remember, alcohol and/or drugs are involved in 90 percent of campus crimes.</p><p>10.	Don’t flash large amounts of cash or other items like jewelry or expensive clothing.  This makes you a prime target for those willing to mug or rob you at a later time.</p><p>11.	Room doors should be equipped with peep holes and deadbolts. Always lock them when you are absent. Do not loan out your key. Have locks changed immediately when a key is lost or stolen. It’s bothersome, but very worth the time.</p><p>12.	Always lock your doors on the 1st AND 2nd floor windows at night. Never leave a door unlocked for your roommate.  Value yourself. Your life and safety are more important than their convenience.</p><p>13.	Do not open your door to anyone unless you''re positive who is on the other side.</p><p>14.	Do not enter elevators with someone who looks suspicious. If you get a bad feeling about them, TRUST IT.  Don’t get on or get off at the next floor and take the next elevator. Report the person to security or the police right away.</p><p>15.	Make it a rule. Do not use stairways alone.</p><p>16.	Mark your property; personal computers, laptops, audio and video equipment with property tags and locks.  Most are available online.</p><p>17.	Visit your college or university’s security office.  Ask questions. Laws require colleges and universities to automatically provide current students and staff with basic campus crime statistics and security policies.

It explains the basic origins and teaching traditions of the three types of Acupuncture Schools available today in North America.', '<p>For thousands of years, there were no schools of Chinese Medicine as we know them today. To understand the development of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine as it is taught today in the west requires a brief look at Chinese history.</p><p>Well over 2000 years ago, Chinese Medicine existed within the body of knowledge known as the Taoist Healing Arts. As healers, the ancient Taoists did not make a distinction between science and spirit. They saw the human body as a combination of physical matter, spirit, and Qi (which can be roughly translated as vital energy). By focusing on balancing one’s Qi, one can develop the ability to synchronize oneself with the balanced Qi of nature, which serves to restore and preserve one’s health. The oldest book known to describe Chinese medicine in detail is the Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Medicine, which dates back to at least 2000 years BCE. Acupuncture is first described here as a practice that restores the normal flow of Qi through the channels (meridians) by stimulating acupuncture points.</p><p>As the Taoist Healing Arts were refined over thousands of years, the secrets were passed down orally and through hands on experience within a student-master relationship. Acupuncture Schools, as such, did not exist. In some cases there were families of master healers who amassed a great body of special healing techniques and integral practices. Generation upon generation were taught and, in turn, contributed to the wealth of healing knowledge. By the 20th century, there were several outstanding lineage-based styles of Chinese Medicine whose depth of knowledge and styles of treatment went far beyond what is taught today as Traditional Chinese Medicine.</p><p><b>The Great Divide:</b></p><p>Chinese Medicine undertook a drastic change in the 1950’s. In an effort to standardize a national medicine of the Marxist state, The People’s Republic of China stripped the ancient teachings and practices of its spiritual dimension, which was deemed “superstitious”. In turn, the government created a single form of teaching that more closely emulated the western biomedical model and censored much of the knowledge gained over thousands of years within the lineage-based styles of Chinese Medicine.</p><p>The resulting form of Traditional Chinese Medicine is taught today in Universities throughout China. This is also the model taught in most acupuncture schools in North America. Although it is based on traditional models of Chinese Medicine, it is only a small portion of the wealth of technique developed by healing masters and handed down during the past 2,000 years</p><p><b>Types of Acupuncture Schools</b></p><p>Today, there are roughly 3 styles of accredited acupuncture schools in North America:</p><p>* <b>TCM schools</b> that follow the standardized curriculum of state run universities developed in Maoist era China. The curriculum is vital, but homogenized to produce western style practitioners.</p><p>* <b>Complementary and Alternative Medicine</b> schools that teach an abbreviated form of acupuncture for those who use it as an adjunct to their primary practice. Primarily M.D.’s and D.O.’s may practice acupuncture with as little as 300 hours of formal training.</p><p>* <b>Lineage-based Schools of Chinese Medicine</b> that teach both the standardized curriculum required for national TCM accreditation plus the ancient teachings and healing techniques that require a spiritual dimension to understand and practice.</p><p><b>About TCM Schools:</b></p><p>While it may seem a harsh judgement, most of the TCM schools represent an Americanized version of Chinese Medicine that bears a growing resemblence to western biomedical training. As Mark Seem (President and CEO, Tri-State College of Acupuncture) notes in the article below, "acupuncture is about to be lost and scattered to the four winds of the health care world." He continues, "The Oriental medicine or TCM style of acupuncture taught at most schools and practiced by most practitioners (especially on the West Coast, where TCM had its biggest influence) is a watered down version of acupuncture in which informed touch plays virtually no role at all."</p><p>More to the point, the study of Qi is fundamental to Chinese Medicine. While Qi is not a religious concept, it does have a spiritual dimension—simply defined as the energy of nature that also exists in the human body. Practitioners who have balance and mastery of their own Qi will be better healers, and most TCM schools do not recognize or emphasize this.</p><p>When you evaluate a TCM school, look into the tradition and teachings of the founder and senior instructors, as well as the curriculum. If the founder is a western businessman, the school is less likely to teach healing technique from ancient Chinese masters. If the curriculum does not include some form of Qi cultivation for its students, it will most likely be limited to the western biomedical model of Chinese Medicine which does not recognize the body of teaching developed from ancient times.</p><p><b>About Complementary and Alternative Medicine Schools:</b></p><p>Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Schools primarily represent an effort to bridge and blend both eastern and western healing arts. In most cases, they do not offer the curriculum that meets the national standards for certification to practice acupuncture, unless you already have an M.D. or D.O. license.</p><p>One notable exception exists, however, in Tai Sophia, Institute, Maryland. Tai Sophia Institute is a graduate school for the healing arts offering three graduate programs in Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine and Applied Healing Arts. Under the guidance of Bob Duggan, M.A., M.Ac, the Institute has been recognized as an anchoring academic institute for the nation''s emerging wellness system, and sets the standard in the field of CAM study, as well as an excellent acupuncture program.</p><p>(For more information on CAM, read "Complementary and Alternative Medical Therapies: Implications for Medical Education" by Miriam S. Wetzel, PhD; Ted J. Kaptchuk, OMD; Aviad Haramati, PhD; and David M. Eisenberg, MD)</p><p><b>About Lineage-based Schools of Chinese Medicine:</b></p><p>While the lineage-based schools encompass all of the modern medicine required for national accreditation and licensing individuals to practice acupuncture, they also include ancient wisdom that is essential for self-development of the healer. Their approach differs from the western biomedical model in that “The essential art of Chinese medicine is the foretelling and prevention of disease rather than the treatment of illness after it has manifested as painful or distressing physical and mental symptoms”. Their teaching is more focused on Qi Cultivation and the subtle laws of energy response. In the ancient tradition, the healer must become the medicine. In addition to learning the appropriate clinical skills, the student must refine their personal energy before one is qualified to practice.</p><p>In a study called Tracing the Contours of Daoism in North America published by the University of California Press, Louis Komjathy says, “The connection between Daoism and health in North America finds its culmination in the establishment of Yo San University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Los Angeles) by Ni Hua-ching and his sons; and Liu Ming’s (then Charles Belyea) involvement in the founding of Five Branches Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Santa Cruz)."</p><p>He further identifies all of the lineage based teachers active in North America, including Jeffery Yuen who is currently the academic dean of acupuncture at Swedish Institute of Acupuncture and Oriental Studies (New York). Other teachers are active at schools focusing on the teaching of Taiji quan, Qigong, Daoist meditation,\r Daoist philosophy, and traditional Chinese healing methods, however they are not accredited to license acupuncturists.</p><p>(For more information on lineage-based schools, read "Tracing the Contours of Daoism in North America" by Louis Komjathy)</p><p><b>Differences in Curriculum:</b></p><p>While the lineage-based schools draw from a greater body of knowledge and tradition than other TCM schools, one can also expect to find a slight difference in curriculum. For example, the student handbook of Yo San University of Traditional Chinese Medicine states, “At Yo San University, Taoism is a guiding philosophy, not a religion.” It further states, “Yo San’s Qi Development curriculum emanates from our belief that practitioners who have balance and mastery of their Qi will be better healers. The study of Qi is not just an academic exercise but is cultivation through daily practice, The program is designed to provide students the opportunity to heal and cultivate themselves and also to directly experience the balance and harmony that underlie Taoism and the medicine that has developed from it.”</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p><b>About the Author:  Lauren Stomel</b></p><p>Mr. Stomel has made a serious occupation in the study of Complementary and Alternative Medicine, particularly in the Five Eements Chinese tradition.

Saving money on textbooks can be achived by following several simple rules. The article lists 6 essential tips that can save you money when buying textbooks.', '<p>The fact that textbooks are expensive is well known. The prices of textbooks climbed in recent years, and many textbooks can cost well over $100. There are several ways, however, by which you can avoid paying the full price for textbooks:</p><p>1. Buy Used Books –– Used books can be much cheaper then new ones. Buying used books is as easy as buying new books, and several leading stores like Amazon, Barnes & Noble and others are offering used books that are sold by third party sellers on their sites. When buying used books pay attention to the condition of the book, and to the credibility of the seller.</p><p>2. Compare Book Prices –– Buying textbooks on the web, lets you do something that was not possible to do prior to the web – Compare the price of the books among dozens of online book sellers. When comparing prices of books make sure you pay attention that you include also shipping cost in the calculation of the price. Several sites like BooksPrice.com allows you to compare the total price of the book including the shipping, and also to choose whether you want to buy used or new books.</p><p>3. Buy several textbooks together –– Buying several books together may reduce the total price of shipping the books, as usually the shipping rate for the second book is lower than the cost for the first book. Few Book Price comparison sites (like BooksPrice) will allow you to compare the price a complete "book cart" and will let you know the cheapest total price for all the books.</p><p>4. Swap Books –– Several new sites offer the ability to swap books that you do not need any more, and to get in return books that you actually need. Swapping books is not just a way to get the books that you want in a low cost, but also to make way for these books on your shelves. Examples of such sites are: bookins.com, swapyourtextbooks.com.</p><p>5. Buy older editions of the book –– Older versions of the textbooks might not be 100% updated but the difference in price is substantial. So substantial in fact, that it might be worth getting that edition which could still be sufficient for the course. For example, price comparison of two different editions of the popular  Biology book by Campbell, reveals that buying an older edition (the fifth edition for example) might be much cheaper then buying the latest edition of the book.</p><p>6. Look for international editions –– Some of the textbooks that are required for a course are also distributed in international editions. These editions can be sometimes much cheaper then the USA edition, but the content will still be the same. For example, if you will compare the prices of the US and international versions of the Biology book by Campbell –– you will find that the international edition (ISBN - 0321269845 ) can be found in a noticeable cheaper price then the US one (ISBN – 080537146X).</p><p>Following these simple rules may save you some money on your text books, thus allowing you to buy more books you really want.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Lucy Orbach is the creator of <a target="_new" href="http://www.booksprice.com">BooksPrice.com - Book Price Comparison</a>.</p><!--UdmComment-->');

The armed forces have partnerships with many non-military colleges and universities that allow people to earn degrees and skills in a certain area that will be recognized by the military, but attending a military college may give you a slight edge above the competition.

They also wear uniforms once a week and engage in drills and other training.</p><p>Tuition Support Programs</p><p>There are four tuition support programs offered by the military; Tuition Assistance, the Montgomery G.I.

Each student can receive up to $250 per credit hour taken each semester or a maximum of $4,500 each year.  The Montgomery G.I. Bill provides $36,000 to pay for tuition in return for a commitment to serve full-time duty. The College Fund Program is offered to enlistees after a honorable discharge.

Paying for college doesn’t have to be impossible and students don’t have to be wealthy in order to get a quality education.  There are a number of ways that almost anyone can afford to pursue the career of their dreams with the education they deserve.</p><p>Many traditional colleges and universities offer a convenient payment plan, which can be divided up into 10-12 months.  After determining the entire yearly cost, that figure would be divided by the number of monthly payments and paid at the college’s billing office.  Payments are usually determined from one year to the next and students must finish paying for one year of college before entering into a payment arrangement for the next.  An example would be a college that would cost $12,000.00 per year in courses, meals and living on campus.  In this scenario, many students can pay $1,000.00 per months for one year.  For many families, a payment plan is much easier than trying to come up with a lump sum payment upfront.</p><p>Every year, many students qualify for federal student loans.

In order to be considered, student’s must be willing and able to provide documented income for themselves and their family so that their loan application can be properly assessed.</p><p>Local businesses, organizations and even colleges often provide scholarships to students who they believe will excel at college studies.  These scholarships are usually available to high school seniors and are based on a number of factors, including grades, participation in school activities, employment and a personal interview.  In order to be considered for a scholarship, students must apply by obtaining an application at their high school guidance counselor’s office or from the organization granting the scholarship.</p><p>For students who are not eligible for the above options, but still want to attend college, there is an alternate option that will gradually help them to work toward their degree.

But how can you spot which is which? Well it is difficult I suppose until you practice a little.

Recently someone attempted this BS on me and they stated;</p><p>“I would like to take a pause here and talk about you for a moment.”</p><p>Wow, talk about me? As in my individual self? What on Earth are we talking about now. She switched the subject to “me” from a scientific academic research discussion. WTF? Warning bells should be on full alert if anyone ever attempts this with you.</p><p>I simply stated; “This issue is not personal it is science. I have no feelings for this issue, yet you refuse to discuss evidence, facts, observation from the leading scientists and Top Researchers in this field. These are not ambiguous groups many have spent 40-years in their research. Who are you to deny all these researchers and their research? What proof do you have? None. So I am appalled that you would deny their information and debate me without any proof.</p><p>You see when an academic pretendee cannot deal with the realities set forth in debate they resort to try to manipulate feelings. I suppose this probably works for them many times.

Despite this knowledge, most find it difficult to maintain a regular writing habit.', '<p>All writers, graduate students, and professors know that they’re supposed to write on a daily basis, or at least as frequently as possible. Despite this knowledge, most find it difficult to maintain a regular writing habit.</p><p>I’m frequently asked for tips on how to make yourself write, even when you don’t feel like it (which for many, is most of the time!)</p><p><b>What is the One Way That’s Guaranteed to Work?</b></p><p>Sorry!  There’s no one correct method.  And what works for you now may not work at some other time.</p><p>So I’ve listed a bunch of ideas below.  Just pick what feels right for you, tweak it if necessary, and see what works!</p><p><b>How to Write Right Now</b><br>\r 1.	Start with right now.  Don’t beat yourself up about what you didn’t do yesterday.  Don’t think about how much you have to do by Friday or next month.  Just do what you need to do at this very moment.<br>\r 2.	Change your writing format.  If you’re used to typing, try longhand.  This can be very freeing.  Or print out your previous writing, and cut and paste it onto index cards in order to organize your thinking.<br>\r 3.	Remove yourself from all normal temptations, such as email and telephones.  You can combine this with the previous tip.  I notice that I get a lot done when I’m on a plane or in a waiting room.  I have a notebook with me, and I start jotting down my thoughts, and sometimes I’m more prolific than when I’m in front of my laptop!<br>\r 4.	Use a timer.  When you turn it on, you know that you can’t do anything else but write.  No email, no Internet, no phone.  The upside is that you know that when the timer goes off, you can stop writing, and do more enjoyable activities.  Try setting the timer for short periods of time and then taking a break; say 30 minutes on and 10 minutes off.  You can use the timer to time your breaks, also.<br>\r 5.	Sign up for my newsletter and receive the “Academic Writer’s Block Wizard.”  Pull it out and use it when you’re stuck!</p><p><b>How to Set Up a Regular Writing Habit</b> <br>\r 1.	Always write first thing in the morning, before showering or reading the paper (caffeine optional.)  If you’re not a morning person, pick another regular time.<br>\r 2.	At the end of each writing session, make a note as to what you will start with next time.<br>\r 3.	Have a special place where you always write.  Set it up with everything you need, and if possible, don’t use this space for other purposes.  <br>\r 4.	Focus on the amount of time spent writing (or trying to write!)  Don’t focus on number or words, paragraphs or pages produced.  What counts is the regular habit of thinking.  Some days will be fruitful and others won’t.  It all counts as long as you put the time in.<br>\r 5.	Track your progress.  This might take the form of an ongoing chart that shows how much you’ve written daily, a journal, or a graph.  One creative client of mine has developed a nice technique.  Whenever she sits down to write, she lights a candle.  This is a signal that she is not “allowed” to do anything but work on her writing.  A nice touch is that she’s saved all the matches that she’s used to light these “writing candles.”  The matches show her how much work she’s actually put into writing.<br>\r 6.	Put writing time into your calendar or daytimer as if it were an appointment.  When others ask if you’re busy then, you can honestly say, “Yes.”<br>\r 7.	Keep a running list of points that you want to cover in your work.  It doesn’t have to be an elaborate outline.  Then when you’re stuck, you can go to your list.  It feels good to check each item off as you cover it.<br>\r 8.	Find a writing buddy.  Agree that you will each write at the same time each day.  You can make this a more firm agreement by calling, writing, or instant messaging each other before or after you work.</p><p>Try one or more of these techniques – I’m sure one will be helpful.  Just remember that the most important step is sitting down to write!</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Gina J Hiatt, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist, tenure coach and dissertation coach and enjoys helping faculty and graduate students complete research, writing projects, and publish, while maintaining high teaching standards and other commitments.

Increasingly in the future opportunities will exist in many areas of government and business, as well as pressure groups, for graduates in environmental studies.

While often these studies are not comprehensive enough to be offered as science degrees by themselves, these courses are more often than not partnered with environmental science degrees as part of a package deal.</p><p>For the environmental science degree student, it can be an advantage. While pursuing their main course of study, they can get qualifications in a number of allied fields. This makes them thorough professionals and capable of entering a wide range of industries when they graduate with their environmental science degree.</p><p>As a result of the long-standing lobbying activities, the United States is home to some of the worlds largest and best funded environmental groups and many professionals, working for these groups, have environmental science degrees.</p><p>Jobs exist with government bodies, lobbying positions with political groups and corporate organizations, research positions with foundations and other research organizations. More opportunities exist in the environmental safety departments of leading oil majors and even faculty positions at colleges offering environmental science degrees. They all offer lucrative positions that professionals with an environmental science degree can hope to secure.</p><p>An environmental science degree does not deal with environmental topics alone. Due to the very nature of their work, professionals who acquire an environmental science degree need to be equipped with allied subjects like compliance, law, criminal justice, and public communication.</p><p>The courses of study that ultimately lead to a environmental science degree are varied and interesting. Someone with an environmental science degree is likely to be tasked with protecting our environment as a result we need the very best!</p><p>If you have a concern about the World we live in or a desire and determination to do something to improve a steadily deteriorating habitat, then an environmental science degree would be an excellent place to start.</p><p>Anyone aspiring to be an environmental professional would typically need to go in for a BS Environmental Science Degree before going for an MS or a PhD in Environmental Studies.</p><p>Environment science degrees are offered in all major colleges and universities across the United States and the Western World.

Follow these 4 easy steps to achieve the LSAT score of your dreams.', '<p>One of the most important steps to getting a high LSAT score happens before you ever open a book to begin studying.  The test date you choose can have a significant impact on how high you score.  To understand the importance, you should know that all LSAT scores are sent to the law schools to which you are applying.  This means that law schools will see every LSAT score you have taken, your best, your worst, and everything in between.  Due to this score reporting, it is advisable you only take the LSAT once, and make your one score count.  The best time to take the LSAT is the June before your senior year.  Taking the test in June means that you are far along enough in your studies, yet you still have plenty of time to apply, and you get the advantage of taking the test during the summer, when you are on a break from school.  While the October test date is still early enough to apply for law school, it also falls around the time of midterms, and you could find yourself stressed and ill-prepared to take the LSAT in the middle of the school semester when so many exams and papers are taking up your time.</p><p>Take your first practice test long before you take the LSAT.  Three to six months before June, schedule a saturday where you will wake up early, sit down at your desk, and take a practice test under the exact same conditions as the real LSAT.  Buy a small, cheap, kitchen timer from the store and set each section''s time exactly.  Only allow yourself the allotted time, and don''t stop or get distracted.  You can easily download practice test online, or buy books with multiple tests.  This first practice test will help you see what score you would make with no studying, and thereby tell you how hard you need to study to get the score you want.  Most importantly, this test will tell you which section you need the most work on.  More than likely you will not have an infinite amount of time to study for the LSAT, so you need to use your time effectively and spend the most time on the sections you score the lowest on.  The national average LSAT score is 150, so you want to strive for over 150.</p><p>Use the data from your first practice test and take more practice tests.  If your worst score was in Analytical Reasoning, take that section of practice tests many times.  As you complete each practice test you will learn how the questions are structured so that you can answer them faster.  You will also start to understand how the tests are scored, so you will learn which answers are correct.  Additionally, you will become familiar with the test so that on test day, you are confident and calm.  Continue taking individual sections as practice tests until you are happy with the score.  Remember that the LSAT is not about memorizing facts.  Therefore, you don''t need to study books or notes.  The LSAT tests your thinking skills.  The best way to improve these skills is with practice.</p><p>The final step in achieving the LSAT score of your dreams is in understanding the scoring of the test.  Each test has approximately 101 questions.  Your score is based on the number of questions you answer correctly.  This means you are not penalized for guessing. You should answer every question, even if you don''t know the answer.  Always make an educated guess if you don''t know the answer.  This also means every question is given the same weight.  If one question has you stumped, circle it and move on.

Taking a Pre-Masters course can significantly ease the transition – both culturally and academically.', '<p>There are so few Pre-Masters courses on the market that students may well wonder what they are. Pre-Masters courses are designed to prepare students for study abroad at the master’s-degree level. They combine instruction in both subject matter and study and self-expression skills that foreign students often need to be competitive when they arrive at universities in the UK, Australia, the US and other foreign countries.</p><p>The fact that you have been or will be accepted for a tertiary program at a foreign university is one indication of the fact that you have already received a good education and have excelled in your chosen field of study. So, it’s helpful to think of Pre-Masters courses as something other than catch-up, or remedial, learning. Instead, think of them as get-ahead courses, which allow you to enter a new learning situation with all the skills necessary to perform well in a new learning environment.</p><p>While university education is basically the same throughout the world, universities in English-speaking countries often stress ways of thinking, learning and, especially, writing that are different enough from those in your country that you could lose time you can hardly afford to lose adapting to new ways of performing academically.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges for many students arriving at foreign universities is learning how to think independently and creatively. In many countries throughout the world, university education is geared toward the mastering of the content in a particular study field. Often it is taught by rote; that is, professors impart the essential information and expect students to learn it thoroughly as taught and then to prove that they know it by essentially repeating it back to the professor in exams.</p><p>While there is considerable value in mastering a field of study in this way, it can foster a kind of thinking that makes it difficult for students to respond when, at universities abroad, they are asked to give their own ideas on a subject and then provide evidence for the validity of those ideas. Like mathematics and languages, new ways of thinking can be learned, but they usually must be studied, demonstrated – and practiced – before they become a real, functioning part of a student’s set of academic skills.</p><p>A large proportion of foreign students going abroad to earn master’s degrees are pursuing fields other than those in which they did their bachelor’s degrees. Many of those fields may require kinds of research you have never had to do in the past, or may ask you to perform such research in a different way. So, learning appropriate research methodologies is also vital to achieving success. This is certainly true for the business fields that most foreign students pursue, even in such seemingly “non-scientific” ones as marketing and management. Don’t be unpleasantly surprised.</p><p>Similarly, new study skills themselves often have to be learned and practiced. Most universities abroad tend to move through complex subject matter quickly – and most foreign students plan to do an entire master’s degree in a single year, if only for economic reasons. These two factors together can create considerable time pressure for many foreign students. The best tactic for coping with an accelerated pace of learning is the development of study skills that allow you to keep up.</p><p>Just to put it in perspective, “keeping up” is often difficult for English-speaking natives of the country whose university you plan to attend. For many foreign students, learning effective time-management skills can be as important as learning the language in which you will be studying.</p><p>Furthermore, in most of the fields foreign students go to international universities to study, there is a strong emphasis on students’ making formal presentations of their own research in classroom or other even more public settings. For many foreign students, this is a completely unfamiliar and, at first, terrifying thing to consider. A Pre-Masters course can teach you the presentation skills, from the verbal presentation of your ideas to the operation of electronic, computer and other high-tech equipment you may need to make visual presentation of your research findings.</p><p>Consider this list of courses, in addition to the ones mentioned above: <br>\r - Academic mathematics<br>\r - Business English (fundamental concepts and vocabulary)<br>\r - Advanced academic writing<br>\r - Problem solving<br>\r - Leadership skills<br>\r - Negotiation skills<br>\r - Management skills<br>\r - Human resources management<br>\r - Finance and accounting<br>\r - Marketing</p><p>If any of them looks unfamiliar to you, or even makes you question whether you’re ready to take them on in a new, fast-paced academic environment, a Pre-Masters course is probably a good idea for you.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="63" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Svend-Nelson_12187.jpg" border="0" alt="Svend Nelson - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>Svend Nelson is an Internet entrepreneur.

If you are involved in a specialized field, there are also specialized master''s programs and seminars that may better suit your specific coursework needs.

You will have to devote a great deal of time and energy in to obtaining a Master of Business or an Online M.B.A. This can leave you with little time for your family and leisure activities. An MBA Program is an investment in yourself, and as with any investment, you need to decide whether the potential return is worth the time and money spent. Having an M.B.A. offers no guarantees that you will get the higher paying jobs that you seek. Look at the financial costs and benefits realistically. There are also many returns beyond financial ones. Having your M.B.A. can allow more job freedom as you would have access to better job opportunities - that can lead to better job satisfaction.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><!--UdmComment-->');

Of course, there are problems here because there is something called institutional accreditation and programmatic accreditation. If a school is institutionally accredited then the entire school is accredited and all its programs are accredited too. But if a school has opted for programmatic accreditation then some of its programs may be accredited while the rest may not be. For example, a school’s technology programs may be accredited but its criminal justice program may not be accredited. So, when checking for accreditation you have to make sure that either the entire school is accredited or that at least its criminal justice program is accredited.</p><p>Accreditation is primarily concerned with checking whether a school or its program is maintaining certain minimum academic standards or not. It is done by a host of bodies but the US Dept of Education grants funding to only six regional accrediting bodies and 2 others that are spin-offs of two out of the six RA bodies. Hence, accreditation by any of these eight agencies is what you should look for.</p><p>Each of these eight accrediting bodies has a specified jurisdiction. They are authorized by the US Dept of Education to grant accreditation to schools falling within their jurisdiction. Hence, if a school wants to get accreditation it must approach the accreditation body that has the authority to grant it accreditation.</p><p>Degrees from accredited schools are accepted and recognized throughout the country. If you want to transfer from one school to another and want to transfer credits earned in your previous school to your new school, then accreditation helps. If your new school is an accredited one, it will allow transfer of only those credits earned in another accredited school. If the credits you have earned are from a non-accredited school they cannot be transferred.</p><p>Just as accredited schools do not recognize degrees and credits earned from non-accredited schools, so do employers. Employers do not recognize degrees earned from schools not accredited by any of the eight bodies authorized by the US Dept of Education. Such degrees are thus, worthless pieces of paper.</p><p>While all 100 per cent of accredited schools will recognize degrees from other schools accredited by the eight bodies mentioned above, only 30 per cent of accredited schools may accept accreditation from a few other new bodies. But this depends and it is, therefore, a big risk if you are getting a degree from a school not accredited by the eight bodies we have talked about but is instead accredited by some other body.</p><p>Accrediting bodies review the accreditation granted to schools periodically. A full- scale site visit review happens every ten years with 5-year progress reports in between. These are peer review site visits and very stringent  – a school must really be up to standard to get accreditation. This means a certain minimum standard of education is guaranteed if you enroll in an accredited school. A non-accredited school doesn’t guarantee anything at all.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>Jim Greenberg recommends you visit the Online Criminal Justice Degree Guide for more information on <a target="_new" href="http://www.ocjdg.com/2006/02/is_an_accredite.html"> accredited online criminal justice programs</a>.</p><!--UdmComment-->');

The usual method of parental funding of college education is out of current income, that is out of your weekly or monthly salary.</p><p>Whilst this is the most common method of funding college education it is one that only the very rich or highly paid can afford to do with ease. Even if there are 2 salaries most families find it difficult and will require sacrifices, even more so if you have more than 1 child.

Your child can work his or her way through college.</p><p>Many students have to work whilst studying but many find the experience of juggling a job, lectures and a social life very difficult. Often the result is that students drop out of college education, fail their exams or don''t do as well as they could.</p><p>3. Your child may have the opportunity to take out student loans to fund their college education.</p><p>Today the vast majority of students are forced to take out student loans to fund all or part of their college education. Usually to subsidize parental contributions, student loans are the most common way of students funding their own college education. Many students however, leave college with substantial debt and even with interest rates at historically low levels today''s students can expect to have to pay substantial monthly repayments for many years.</p><p>4. Your child may obtain a scholarship or be entitled to grants from either federal or local funds towards the cost of their college education.</p><p>There are many sources of student scholarships or grants and with a bit of research most students today can find some grant funding. These sources however cannot be guaranteed for the future. Whilst scholarships and grants do not have to be repaid and as such are preferable to loans they are not guaranteed or predictable and therefore relying on them for our children is a risk.</p><p>5. Take out an education savings plan to fund college education.</p><p>An education savings plan is a regular saving plan into which you and your children can contribute. The plans are administered by colleges or state authorities and can be taken out for any child including a newborn babies. Because of the effects of long term compound interest the earlier you take out your plan the easier it will be and the lower your contributions will be. Because the funds are built up prior to going to college students do not have to rely on scholarships, grants or loans and they can concentrate on their studies.</p><p>There are a number of options to fund your child''s college education but the only way funds can be guaranteed is by you taking out an education savings plan. With the education savings plan you decide what you can invest and your child can also contribute to his or her college education. With luck scholarships and grants will still be available as will loans to top up if necessary.

These students are becoming more and more robotic in a greatly increasing competitive atmosphere.  Although a student''s academic career is the main focus of the applicants, the problem lies when the college has to figure out what to do when they have too many applicants with a grade point average of 3.8-4.0.  There have been several circumstances where the student with the 4.0 does not get into the college and student with the lower grade point average does.</p><p>Of course colleges are looking for those students who can do well academically, but they also want their students to come with a certain energy towards innovation.  They want their students to be able to contribute creatively and receive some sort of recognition eventually.  Basically, colleges need those students who can go beyond expectation.  They need the students who have a love in life beyond academics.  They need students who can excel outside of the classroom; at sports, volunteer work, dancing, traveling, and the list goes on and on.  These students also need to be able to present this in a 4-8 page college application.  Now, how do you do this? How does one go about preparing for this task?</p><p>It is very important that a student do two things while also maintaining a good grade point average.  They must have personal time to themselves to breathe and relax and they also have to commit to something that they love to do outside of the classroom.  The students who stay committed to one activity for three years show a much stronger level of commitment and motivation than the student that who participates in twenty activities for a short period of time.  However, the students who participate in two or more activities for two or more years show even more potential than those with only one.</p><p>When colleges get applications that show various extra-curricular activities with no connection to each other, they question them.  Some of these applications will have all different kinds of activities like "one month volunteering at a homeless shelter, three months at a vet hospital, 6 months in dance lessons" etc.  Although these applications are full of extra curricular activities, these students show questionable motivation and a lack of commitment.  This may simply mean that the student participated in the activities for the sole purpose of filling up that page in the college application.  Sometimes these assumptions are clarified in the student''s essay but there are times when they are not and this does not look good for the applicant no matter what his or her grades are like.</p><p>Students should always keep in mind that colleges want those students who can think critically.

And why shouldn’t they? Traditional nursing schools seem to increase tuition costs, offer schedules not appropriate for working nurses, and reject qualified students from enrolling due to capacity shortages.', '<p>Registered Nurses (RN) seeking a Masters of Science Degree in Nursing (MSN) are increasingly enrolling into online nursing degree programs. And why shouldn’t they? Traditional nursing schools, all campus based schools for that matter, seem to increase tuition costs beyond the rate of inflation each year. Classes are often not scheduled at times appropriate for working nurses. And qualified nursing students are rejected or delayed from enrolling due to capacity shortages. RN’s seeking their MSN can take control of their higher education goals through online degree completion programs.</p><p><b>The Online Nursing Education Revolution Is Now</b></p><p>There currently exists RN to MSN programs online which carry the same accreditation standards as traditional campus based programs. One such program was formulated through a partnership of two educators: The College Network and Regis University. Together, The College Network and Regis University have created RN to MSN programs online accredited by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (AACN-CCNE). Take another look at your first college of choice and see if they too are accredited by the AACN-CCNE.</p><p>The College Network is one of the nation’s largest publishers of educational materials. Regis University has been consistently ranked as one of “America’s Best Colleges” by U.S. News and World Report. The RN to MSN programs online they have created utilize blended learning formats of independent study, local mentoring, online classes, discussion groups, chats, emails, streaming video, and video conferencing. All of these educational tools keep you active and in touch with educators and fellow nursing students.</p><p>The College Network – Regis University RN to MSN programs online feature study guides and practicum materials written by nationally recognized educators. In addition, all practicum courses are mentored by local preceptors to eliminate the need for travel and clinical testing. Are you expecting to move within the next 12 months? Not a problem at all. Testing centers are available in all 50 states, at most military bases worldwide and American Embassies. The College Network – Regis University RN to MSN online program relocates when you do.</p><p><b>Why Registered Nurses Choose Online Programs</b></p><p>One of the most frustrating issues nursing students face today must be the wait to begin studies. Traditional campus based programs, even those with some online coursework, can take one to two years or more just to get accepted. A recent article posted by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) states that USA nursing schools actually turned away more than 30,000 “qualified” applications in 2005! Proof that traditional campuses can not meet the current demand for more, and higher educated nurses. The College Network – Regis University RN to MSN programs online can start RN’s in less than 30 days.</p><p>Another frustrating issue faced by nursing students today is inflexible course schedules. Busy Registered Nurses  must juggle course schedules with career and family responsibilities. Four to Five years is a long time to sacrifice the things that matter most in your life. Because of the inflexibility of traditional nursing schools, many Registered Nurses postpone their pursuit of a RN to MSN nursing degree. Nurses whom chose RN to MSN programs online enjoy flexible, accelerated or slow paced studies – they are in control.</p><p>Many Registered Nurses remember what it was like to attend class on a traditional campus. Not looking forward to that again? Nurses who choose RN to MSN programs online have no classes to attend, avoid crowded lecture rooms, and remove time wasted commuting to and from campus.</p><p><b>How RN to MSN Programs Online Work</b></p><p>The College Network’s RN to MSN programs online are generally divided into two phases. First, the RN to MSN student utilizes comprehensive learning materials, created to prepare them to test out of prerequisites and general education courses. Second, the RN to MSN degree student enrolls into the Regis University online degree program to receive college credit, and to complete practicum courses and experience requirements.</p><p>According to The College Network, the first phase of the RN to MSN programs online offers the most flexibility, as the learning materials and challenge exams can be completed anywhere, anytime, fast, slow, at your own pace. Once the prerequisites and general education courses are completed, students begin the second phase of their RN to MSN programs online. Throughout your RN to MSN degree program, academic support is available by phone 8am to 11pm Monday through Friday. Help is available when you need it, day and night.</p><p>Second phase coursework is completed online, with no required campus visits or specified log-in times. Practicum courses are mentored by local preceptors which eliminates any travel and clinical testing. All learning is flexible to meet your individual needs. Through it all, The College Network makes every effort to provide convenience and assistance to you to ensure your success. Most students finish the complete RN to MSN program in 3 years.</p><p><b>Cost of RN to MSN Programs Online</b></p><p>Each Registered Nurse’s program cost will vary based upon factors such as the availability of transfer credits and work experience. At The College Network, a program advisor is assigned to each potential student to review their individual goals and curriculum requirements. The program advisor can also discuss available pre-approved financing options and how to apply for federal financial aid.</p><p>Nursing students can realize savings of 50% to 70% versus traditional campus degree costs. These savings estimates do not include savings on transportation to and from school, childcare, parking, nor room and board. With annual college tuition rates reaching $20,000 to $30,000 per year, a simple 50% annual savings is $10,000 to $15,000 that can be saved by completing your RN to MSN programs online.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>It’s no wonder why more nurses are choosing to obtain their advanced degree through RN to MSN programs online. Registered Nurses now have respectable alternatives to waiting for acceptance, ever increasing tuition costs, and inflexible class schedules. The College Network – Regis University partnership is a unique and innovative way to deliver the same accredited nursing education. For nurses seeking an RN to MSN program, each year forgone is less money earned and a missed managerial position. Discuss online education with your hiring manager, then take control of your higher education needs.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"></div><p>John Napoletano is a contributing author and founder of NursingDegree.Net, a free directory of accredited nursing schools and nursing related resources.

What are those challenges and opportunities?', '<p>Leaving High School and going to college or university is a major change for any student. A new college or university student will find themselves in a different world to their previous time at school, a world in which they will face new challenges and opportunities in study, perhaps their first crack at independence from home, and the temptations of a potentially limitless social life.</p><p>For a High School student preparing themselves for the transition to college, there are number of factors with which it is wise to get familiar, before that first day at their new home of study. This article looks briefly at some of the differences that a student will face in their new life.</p><p><strong>A New Class Format – Adjusting to the Lecture Style</strong></p><p>One of the major differences students will face is the lecture style used in colleges and universities, which can seem very different to the High School recitation type of teaching. Attending lectures, and making the most of them from an educational point of view, requires a different attitude and some new study skills from the student. Making the adjustment to the college lecture room from the high School classroom is one that the student needs to make from the outset if they are to perform well.</p><p><strong>The Quantity and Quality of Work</strong></p><p>Any High School student probably realizes that the work they will do at college or university will be more advanced. That, surely, is what going to college is all about? However, it can still come as something of a shock to new college students, to suddenly be thrust into this new level of learning. It is best to be mentally prepared for a far more demanding level of education, which will stretch the student''s mind right from the start. There will no be time to “ease your way in”. Falling behind in the first few weeks can be difficult to recover from and achieve the grades you are seeking.</p><p>New college students should also be aware that the work required is not only of a higher quality than High School, but also much greater in quantity. Those who are not prepared for that will also suffer in the early stages of college life. The workload may seem overwhelming if you are not ready for it.</p><p><strong>Hooray, Freedom at Last</strong></p><p>For many students who go away to university or college, it will be their first taste of freedom from parental discipline. That is an essential step that all young people have to take at some time or another, and it can be a wonderful time of your life, when the transition to adulthood really starts to take place.</p><p>However, that new found freedom can be a distraction from study if it is allowed to dominate your new college life. It is possible to enjoy the freedom of college life, and to succeed in your primary purpose of being there; that is, get good grades and graduate with honours. Both sides of your new life require self discipline, and by applying that self discipline both to your study and college social life, you can find the right balance. It is not easy, but it can be achieved.</p><p><strong>Managing Your Finances</strong></p><p>Many students may not agree, but one of the most important changes from being at home and going to High School, and then going away to college, is the need to manage your own finances. This is probably something you have not dealt with before, but from now on, you will probably always have to. How you deal with your finances at college may well dictate how well you do so when you get your first job.</p><p>Your personal finances are one subject for which you can plan in some detail before going to college, so that you know what to expect once you get there. Learning about budgeting your finances will stand you in good stead for years to come.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="118" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Roy-Thomsitt_1601.jpg" border="0" alt="Roy Thomsitt - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>This <a target="_new" href="http://www.learningstraight.com/How2UseURMindSP.htm">study skills</a> article was written by Roy Thomsitt, owner and author of the Learning Straight web site.

But what areas of college life and education do you need to focus on, and what study skills do you need, to get great grades?', '<p>During the early days at college, you will be setting the foundations for all your future studies. This is, therefore, a crucial time in tilting you towards success or failure. As with anything new, you will soon form habits, and it is up to you to ensure that those habits are good habits.</p><p>There are certain areas of college life and study in which establishing good habits early on can help you towards your goal of good grades and a successful graduation. It is well worth focusing your attention on these areas before arriving at college, and in your first few weeks there. By doing so, you can establish some good study habits, and make your college life run that much more smoothly and successfully. The following are some of the key areas of your new life of college study where you will need solid preparation and attention from the outset.</p><p><strong>Acknowledging the Competition</strong></p><p>It is the brighter students at High School who will probably be the ones who make it to college and university. You were one of those, but you will notice a big difference in your relative position at college. Whereas before you may have been one of the top students in your class, once you get to college you will just be one of many bright students.</p><p>By being aware of this increased competition, and being mentally prepared for it, you are more likely to shine again in your new environment, rather than feeling overawed by the other intelligent students. Also bear in mind that with the right preparation and improvement of your study skills, and by establishing the right habits, you can perform better than even the most intelligent student.</p><p><strong>Scheduling Your Time</strong></p><p>One of the big differences at college will be the amount of “spare” time you have. You may only have 15 hours of lectures in a week, and it is up to you to schedule the rest of your time. Whether you succeed at college or not may well depend on how well you are able to organize yourself, and schedule your time to best effect.</p><p>So long as you are aware of the dangers of wasting that spare time, then you will have a chance of scheduling it wisely. <a target="_new" href="http://www.routes-to-self-improvement.com/TimeManagement.htm">Time management</a> skills are therefore worth acquiring before you even go to college, and there is plenty of useful information online about managing time. Regard time management as an essential study skill, and prepare accordingly. It will stand you in good stead for the future after college as well, as time management is just as important in business or working life.</p><p><strong>Harder Work</strong></p><p>One thing is certain, and that is college work will be much tougher than High School work. If, after a few weeks, you do not think it is harder, then the chances are you have not grasped what you really need to do to keep up with and on top of your studies. You should go to college expecting to work hard, and then ensure that you do.</p><p><strong>Note Taking</strong></p><p>Another major difference between the learning methods at High School and college is the need, at college, to take copious notes in the lecture room. You should be mentally prepared for this at a minimum, but, like time management, you can acquire skills on note taking to make yourself more efficient. You will be pressed for time at college, so in every aspect of your study, it is wise to improve your study skill. That includes note taking.</p><p><strong>Faster Reading</strong></p><p>In the lecture room you need to become efficient at taking notes. Outside of the lecture room, you will have an enormous amount of reading to do. Such a volume may seem overwhelming, but reading is another area where you can improve, and thus increase your ability to study effectively. Speed reading is a talent anybody can acquire, and if you can acquire it before you reach college, so much the better.</p><p><strong>Memory</strong></p><p>Once at college, you will be bombarded with information, facts relating to the subjects you are studying. Being great at reasoning and making use of facts is no use if you cannot remember those facts in the first place. Improving your memory is therefore something you will benefit greatly from. Even if you think you have a good memory, you can improve further.</p><p>I went back to studying, for a professional qualification, 12 years after leaving school. Not being academic as a student, and having a “poor” memory, I knew I would have great difficulty competing mostly against 21/22 year olds fresh from university. So, I focused on my memory, learnt as much as I could about memory techniques, and that was enough (plus hard work, of course) to not only help me keep up, but in some cases keep ahead of the competition.</p><p>Improving memory really does make a big difference to your study prospects, and also in later working life. It is another study skill that will always be with you as you move on to other things after college or university.</p><p>By preparing yourself in the areas of note taking, time management, faster reading, and memory, you should have a head start on other students, even if they are brighter than you. By such preparation and focusing on your study skills before going to college, it is you who will appear the brightest, as you come across as well organized, able to grasp and recall facts with ease, and able to get through a lot more work in a shorter time than those around you.</p><div style="float: right; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: white; background-color: white"><img height="90" width="118" src="http://ezinearticles.com/members/mem_pics/Roy-Thomsitt_1601.jpg" border="0" alt="Roy Thomsitt - EzineArticles Expert Author"></div><p>This <a target="_new" href="http://www.learningstraight.com/Study_Skills_for_College.htm">study skills</a> article was written by Roy Thomsitt, owner author of The Learning Straight web site.</p><p>Do you want to succeed at college and still enjoy the social life to the full?

Some people believe that online learning is not as interpersonal or dynamic as traditional face-to-face learning.  This is a large misconception that has lead people to believe that online learning is impersonal.  This is not the case at all and programs online, believe it or not present the same opportunities for group work, independent study, and communication just as it is in the traditional classroom setting.  College online actually helps the independent learning process, and also helps to develop time management skills that many university students lack.  Attending classes online require the same amount as commitment if not more than going to school.</p><p>There are also many advantages for those students seeking online degrees.  First of all, the student does not need to live anywhere near the school to attend.  Attending class and submitting work online gets rid of the need to commute daily.  Getting an online degree is a very convenient way to advance a student''s education and training.  The school may offer those online more sections of the course as well as night and weekend times for more flexibility.  This is a really great setup for those students who have full time jobs or have other commitments.  Also, if you are an individual who is returning to school, taking an online course can make your transition a lot easier.  Besides, why wouldn''t you want to attend college at home in your pyjamas?</p><p>It is also very possible to earn an online degree in a fraction of the time it would take to do it at a college or university.  Many online programs offer accelerated programs that are really ideal if you want to advance your career in a hurry.  Several online programs offer students the option to attend part time.  This can be very important in having your degree recognized by potential employers.  Attending a fully accredited online university is critical especially if you decide to transfer to another college later because your credits will not transfer from a non-accredited college.  It is very important to make sure you check the credentials of the online institution before signing up for classes.</p><p>If you are worried about affording an online university there are several options for payment available.  Some employers even offer to pay part of their employees'' tuition fees towards their degree.  You can also use governmental financial aid in the form of grants and loans and even scholarships if you qualify.  You can check with your online program of interest to receive details of what options are available to you.</p><p>The type of degree that you can earn at an online institute is limitless aside from the associates, bachelors, and PhD degrees.  Professionals can continue their education and stay up to date in their fields.  The world of online learning is no longer only for computer programmers and web designers.

One area that you want to look for, as it is in high demand today, and will only get bigger in the near future, is in the accounting information systems.

A quality University will meet the minimum state requirements that will lead to certification in one of the following possibilities: certified public accountant (CPA); certified management accounting (CMA); and certified in financial management (CFM) or chartered financial analyst (CFA) certification.

As expected, many college courses fill up quickly, which is why early applications often stand a better chance of acceptance.</p><p>Before applying to certain colleges and/or universities, it is a good idea to review their freshman enrollment requirements.  These requirements generally pertain to anyone who has graduated from high school within the past five years.  Beyond that, required high school courses are not as highly considered due to the fact that so much time has passed.  Therefore, even if you did not take the necessary high school courses, you may be able to attend the college of your choice if you are willing to wait for five or more years before enrolling.</p><p>Almost every college and/or university charges an application fee when applying.  This fee is generally very reasonable and is often less than $50.00.  This is a non-refundable fee, which is not refunded for any reason including a denial of acceptance.

At that time, the school will either send a letter of congratulations or one of denial.</p><p>Many modern colleges and universities have websites and even allow applications to be submitted online.  This is believed to speed up the application process and may result in a quicker decision than if submitted by mail.  In the case of online applications, the application fee will generally be charged to a major credit card.  If you do not have a credit card, you may have to mail your application along with a check or money order.  It is important to remember that, under no circumstances, should you ever send cash through the mail.</p><p>Once you receive the college or university’s acceptance, if applicable, it will be time to begin plans for enrollment.
